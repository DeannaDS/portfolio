This project involved collecting social network analysis data from approximately 100 members of the regional food system in Ashland and Bayfield Counties. Data cleaning was performed using Python. A [publicly available visualization] (https://kumu.io/ext-webapps/chequamegon-bay-food-producers) was creating with Kumu. The analysis was performed using R using both igraph and statnet. 

ERGM was used to predict the liklihood of collaboration.
