# Evaluating the Communication and Collaboration Network of Extension Employees

This project involved collecting social network analysis data from 80 UW-Madison Division of Extension employees regarding the frequency with which they communicated and collaborated with one another. The analysis was performed using R using both igraph and statnet. 

ERGM was used to predict the liklihood of collaboration.

This project was presented at the 2019 [UW-Madison IT Leadership Conference](https://itlc.it.wisc.edu/). The "6 Degrees of Extension" pdf document was the presentation at that conference.
