# Classifying Loans - A Machine Learning Approach

The goal of this project was to improve a fictional bank's revenue generation from loans by creating a model that accurately predicts loan defaults.

The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, correlation examination, and classification. It was completed using R and was knit to Word using RMarkdown. Code snippets are included in the Word Document.

The complete code file is available upon request, but is not included so that future students are not provided a ready-made project.
