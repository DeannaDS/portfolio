1|Consumer Gardening Programs|Gardening has continued to be one of the favorite hobbies of Americans. According to the National Gardening Association in 2014, 35% of all households in America, or 42 million households, are growing food at home or in a community garden, up 17% in five years. UW-Extension and Master Gardener Volunteers provide research based programs and resources needed to support gardening as an enjoyable, satisfying, and environmentally responsible activity. However, still many working adults, parents and senior citizens in the county lack the knowledge and confidence to be successful gardeners.|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
2|New Farm Beginnings|Agriculture is the top industry in Clark County and Trempealeau Counties and much of my programming reflects that, whether it is offering Farm Succession Workshops, water quality testing, or agricultural plastics recycling. A majority of farms are family owned and the average age of a cropland owner is 65 years or older, hence a need for farm succession planning. In addition, as farmers look to diversify in changing economic climates, the need for farm management education is more important than ever.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
3|Crops/Soil 2019-2020|Improving forage quality, production and management practices continues to be a key factor in the success of dairy and livestock farms. Forage crops account for nearly half (48%) of all cropland in Waupaca county, primarily alfalfa (67%) and corn silage (33%). A new local watershed project received federal funding in 2018 to help improve and protect water quality in Bear Lake and the Lower Little Wolf River through expanded soil conservation and nutrient management practices. The Waupaca County Forage Council remains a primary avenue for local UW-Extension forage and soil/water conservation outreach efforts.|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
4|Dairy 2019-2020|Dairy remains the leading farm enterprise in Waupaca County accounting for two-thirds of all farm sales. Low milk prices for 2-3 years and a shrinking labor supply has many dairy farmers exploring options to improve productivity and/or labor efficiency, and some exploring shifting from a dairy to beef farming.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
5|Animal Agriculture (2019)|"Agriculture is a prominent industry in Grant County and one major concern for farmers is remaining profitable in this poor economic time. Low milk prices have plagued the dairy industry since 2015 with the low milk prices projected to continue into 2019. We have seen some transitions and diversification in enterprises. We have especially seen dairy farmers transitioning to beef enterprises. The need for beef production programming in this area is evident through the 2016 Grant County Extension Needs Assessment Survey where respondents were asked to rate 11 educational topic areas where Beef Production ranked third and 29% of respondents viewed Beef Production as ""Very Important"" to Grant County. Programing efforts will be focused on providing unbiased, researched based information."|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
6|Crop Production |Forage and grain crop production is a staple of livestock agriculture. Quality forage is essential for dairy farm profitability. Additionally small livestock farms and beef operations are common in Clark County. Clark County has 156,000 acres committed to forage production. Most of this forage production is used to feed the county's livestock. Clark County has 131,200 acres committed to grain production. Crop revenue is $33 million annually, 10% of the total agriculture production sales (2012 Census of Agriculture), but a majority of the grain produced is used to feed the 160,000 head of cattle and calves in the county.A goal is to improve yield and quality of forage and grain by all producers in Clark County. Producers must continually adapt new management practices to remain profitable. The needs assessment identified grain and forage production programming as a need in the county.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
7|Farm Business Management |An area of interest and concern for dairy producers in Marathon County is remaining profitable. With low milk prices for the last three years and projected low prices to continue into 2019 this is even more important. In a needs assessment producers indicated that proper nutrition, milk quality, and reproductive success were important to keeping their business profitable. Designing breeding programs that optimize genetics and reproductive efficiency are important in creating a profitable dairy business. Therefore, this agent will focus on providing support and education to producers looking to create a profitable dairy business. Efforts will focus on milk quality, animal wellbeing, reproduction and genetic selection.The Dairy Industry remains paramount to the success of agriculture in Marathon County. With the low commodity prices seen in 2016 for both grain crops and milk, dairy producers need to have a close eye on their finances. Having a strong understanding of Farm Financial Business Management allows farmers to maximize their bottom line.In order to maintain profitable dairy farms, producers in Marathon County need to understand farm financial management. Farm financial management education in Marathon County centers on increasing awareness of budgeting and succession planning.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
8|Livestock Management (2019)|Marquette County has a formalized specialization agreement with Adams, Green Lake, Juneau, Portage, Waushara, and Wood Counties known as the Central Wisconsin Agriculture Specialization (CWAS). The responsibilities of this educator will primarily be planning and implementing educational sessions or services that relate to livestock management and production in Marquette County as well as the six counties listed here. The specialized agents in Adams, Green Lake, Juneau, Portage, Waushara, and Wood Counties have similar responsibilities in their respective agriculture education field: Adams historically provided agronomy and nutrient management; Green Lake provided commercial horticulture and nutrient management instruction; Juneau provided dairy and forage management; Portage provided vegetable production; Waushara provided farm business management; Wood provides dairy and cranberry production. At the start of 2019, the Adams and Green Lake positions are now filled and Waushara has an interim agent. With the addition of new staff, adjustments of areas of specialty may need to be addressed.In Marquette County, on an annual basis, agriculture provides $593 million of economic activity (66% of the county's total economic activity) and jobs for 43% of the county workforce. Livestock sales account for 45% of the market value of products sold by farms. The 2012 Census of Agriculture estimates that there are 14,569 cattle and calves in Marquette County. In Marquette County, there are 88 operations with beef cattle and 48 with dairy cattle. There are 25 operations raising pigs and 16 operations with sheep. In the larger CWAS area, there are a total of 13,291 beef cows on 872 farms. Most farms have under 50 cows.60,105 milking cows on 673 farms. Most farms have over 100 milking cows.24,416 broiler chickens on 137 farms. over 28,758 laying hens on 544 farms. Most farms have under 50 laying birds.763 turkeys on 45 farms.over 4,511 pigs on 183 farms. The majority of farms have under 25 pigs.3,507 sheep on 150 farms. The majority of farms have under 25 sheep.8,035 horses, ponies, burros, donkeys, and mules on 1,344 farms.997 rabbits on 61 farms.Having reviewed the farm statistics, the results support that the majority of livestock farmers in the area are generally small-scale farmers. These farms are often diversified with multiple species present based on my on-farm observations over the past five years.In the 2014 formal needs assessment, grazing and pasture management continues to be a prominent educational programming desire in Marquette County. In addition to the formal (written) needs assessment, based on the types of livestock questions made to the UW-Extension office throughout the year, education on animal nutrition, management, and care would be of interest to adult and youth livestock farmers. These observations lead to an interest in expanding the contact list to include more livestock producers (besides beef) and diversify livestock programming efforts to reach out to non-beef livestock producers in addition to beef programming efforts.According to a national study completed by the National Animal Health Monitoring System (published in 2012 by the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service), 56% of small-scale (under $500,000 in gross annual sales) livestock operators preferred to get management/care information from local Cooperative Extension offices. A preference for written publications for additional management/care information was a close second with 49.4% of operations. This information supports the importance of local Cooperative Extension offices in not only directly providing research-based information to farmers, but also the need to contribute to relevant periodicals that farmers may read.|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
9|General Horticulture Programming|Gardening and horticulture is one of the top leisure activities with some reports showing over 85% of people participate. Food production in home and community gardens continues to increase, and the therapeutic and mental health benefits of working with plants and nature are becoming increasingly recognized. Consumer gardening practices can greatly affect personal, public and environmental health. The high number of inquiries into Extension offices indicates local residents need research based information to be successful. The 6 county area of Pierce, Polk, St. Croix, Dunn, Eau Claire and Chippewa have a mix of urban and rural areas, with a strong history of participation in horticultural events and activities, and a commitment to environmental protection.|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
10|Farm Risk Management (2019)|With several years of depressed agriculture commodity prices, farmers are looking for alternative ways to make a profit with their farm. In past years farmers have relied on corn and soybean production to supplement their on-farm income. With rising agriculture input costs coupled with low commodity prices in recent years, farmers are looking for new ways to meet their bottom line.A prior needs assessment revealed that farm financial/business management, specifically cost of production calculations, measuring enterprise profitability, and financial management information are priorities for producers in Marquette County. In addition, farm transfers/estate planning and tax management are of interest to farmers in Marquette County. Other topics of interest included farm product marketing and land use/natural resource management issues. The visioning session for this position also emphasized the importance of farm business management and meeting the needs of limited-resource farmers.|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

12|Agriculture Management|According to the Census of Agriculture-USDA 2016 Wisconsin Agriculture Statistics, Green County is home to 29,000 dairy cows and 245 licensed dairy farms. In 2018, Wisconsin lost 638 dairy farms which is a 7.25% decline. Green County also has around 46,000 head of beef cattle and other animal species. We farm over 192,000 acres of cropland. Farming across the United States has been hit with some tough times. Agriculture producers are trying to find ways to diversify farm income so their farms survive. At the present time, it's not just dairy farmers who are looking for ways to make extra income. Due to tight margins, programming is needed to share with producers ways to make extra income. Programs that focus on efficiency and sharing profitable production practices is one example. Another option is assisting dairy producers consider and implement income alternatives if they decide to sell the herd. Helping agriculture producers understand their current situation (financial and operational), where they want to be and how they can get there is something every producer needs to think about whether they stay in farming or choose another route. The average age of farmers is 56 years and it is difficult for them to determine their succession plan. I just started into this position in Green County in August of 2018. Part of my plans are to create a needs assessment for the farmers to see what their needs are. Currently planning is based on my personal experiences in the agriculture industry and what co-workers, Ag and Extension Committee, and the past educator has done. Green County is also working on developing a water testing plan protocol and along with the results of the SWIGG study in nearby counties, many farmers in Green County are wondering if agriculture is playing a part in water contamination. Providing seminars on water quality related to agriculture is being planned and continuing to talk about water quality in the future on radio shows and articles will be happening.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
13|Cranberry Programming|Wisconsin leads the nation in cranberry production with over 60% of the nations crop. In Wisconsin the cranberry crop is worth over $100 million at the farm and provides many job opportunities in support industries such as cranberry warehousing, processing, marketing and crop inputs. In Wood County the industry is over $40 million at the marsh level.The industry has suffered low prices for a number of years now and growers are looking for sustainable practices that improve yield while minimizing the cost of crop inputs. This includes more labor saving harvest practices, precision timing and research based fertilizer applications utilization of new chemistry of pesticides as released to replace old products no longer available utilizing pest management principles.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
14|Dairy/Livestock Production|As Richland County continues to see changes in demographics and funding there has been a primary change to the role of the Agriculture agent in Richland County. The county decided to reduce the position to a half time position. Also with in that same time frame Crawford County had a vacancy in its agriculture position. It was then agreed upon to move to a split position were 50% time was in Richland and 50% time in Crawford. The two counties are very similar with regards to its agricultural community. According to the 2012 Census of Agriculture Data, Richland County has 1,260 farms and Crawford County has 1,105. Both counties showed a trend down from the 2007 census. While the number of farms has been decreasing, the average size has increased. Land used for agricultural production is predomantly used for crop production in both counties, with 45% and 49 % percent of Crawford and Richland County's Ag land devoted to crop production. The census data also shows us that market value of the products sold is increasing on Richland County farms as well. As a County, the market value of agricultural products sold in 2012 was $115,451,000 up 37% from the 2007 Census of Agriculture. Looking at the breakdown, Richland County is still heavily reliant on sales generated by livestock and their products (72% of the agricultural sales). While Crawford County is more balanced with 50% of its agricultural sales coming from Livestock sales. A quick overview of the agricultural sector in Richland County shows us that the top agricultural commodities in Richland County by sales are: Milk, Grain, Cattle & Calves, Fruits/ Tree nuts / Berries, and Vegetables. Top Commodities for Crawford County are: Cattle & Calves, Grains, and Hogs and Pigs. While being focused on livestock production, Richland and Crawford Counties offer very diverse landscape with many very small agricultural operations. Utilizing the farm finical data offered by USDA, 70% of Richland County farms and 68% of Crawford County Farms had less than $25,000 in gross sales (2012). Sales of agricultural products in this range are an indication that these producers are not utilizing agriculture as their primary income, and agriculture as a part of their lifestyle. Lifestyle producers view agriculture as a way to supplement their land base, add extra income or enhance their quality of life. From the increase in the number of calls and office visits; it is evident that basic animal husbandry, market development and environmental resources are needed.|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

According to a Wisconsin agriculture and economy impact report in 2014, the horticulture business in Brown County has generated $6.3 million in economic activity, providing thousands of full-time and many seasonal jobs. This lucrative industry has an increasing need for educational programs on sustainable Green Industry practices and diagnostic services. They are listed as two of the top five educational needs at various short course program and Greenhouse growers' seminar evaluations. Sustainable Green Industry practices improve the environment by conserving resources, reduce chemical applications, save labor costs and improve the safety and health of the employees.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
18|Crops and Soils 2019|The past five years have seen margins on cash crops decline from all-time highs. At this same time farmers are seeing rapid increases in new technologies, that may or may not be profitable to adopt at this time, increases in herbicide resistance in weeds. There continues to be an increase in the number of acres of cash grain crop production in Monroe and the surrounding counties. With tight margins, many farmers are seeking unbiased information on crop management practices and pest management. Soil conservation, quality and nutrient management are also topics of great interest to farmers, especially ways to control input costs and maximizing returns in these areas. Observations and discussions with farmers regarding crop production have indicated that there is a need for unbiased information regarding risk management, best management practices and integrated pest management. There is also a need for updated basic crop marketing information to help producers help make it through the current economic situation. Farmers still get a lot of pressure from some sales people to purchase inputs that may not be most profitable for the farmer. There is an increase in herbicide resistance problems in the area , in particular increased incidences of waterhemp in fields , that require changes in management practices.Discussions with Land Conservation personel and Department of Agriculture Personel have also indicated an increased need for nutrient management planning in the area.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
19|Soil Conservation|Situation StatementThe average age of farmers continues to increase in Trempealeau County (USDA, ERS, 2017). Finances to start a new farm business are often challenging for people that do not have an established family farm to work into because of the high value of land and buildings. The value of land and buildings in farms in Trempealeau County increased from $892,303 in the 2007 census of agriculture to $1,033,131 in the 2012 census of agriculture (USDA Census of Agriculture, 2012). Purchasing an existing farm is out of reach of many people that desire to start farming. Economics in commodity agriculture have been extremely bleak for the last five years as corn, soybean, and milk prices have been at or below the cost of production for most farmers. Adding value through direct marketing of farm products and agritourism are ways that existing or new farms can generate more revenue and profit. Needs analysis conducted with key stakeholder groups has highlighted the need to bring new farm businesses into Trempealeau County while enhancing the ability of farms to be profitable for the operators of the farms. Direct marketing of agricultural production can take many avenues as the commodities produced are varied. Some commodities may require processing to market direct while others may be sold without processing. Licensing requirements will vary from none needed with fresh vegetables at farmers markets to many with a dairy commodity such as cheese or ice cream. Setting up a direct marketing agricultural enterprise can be daunting. People need to enter the process fully aware of the requirements and challenges ahead of them. Soil erosion and soil health is a concern of partners and stakeholders of Trempealeau County UW-Extension as shown in key stakeholder needs analysis. Dairy farm numbers have decreased in Trempealeau County and more corn is grown in the county. Data from the Census of Agriculture show 195 dairy farms with a total of 21,373 cows in Trempealeau County (USDA, National Statistics Service, 2012) down from 733 dairy farms and 33,144 cows in 1987 (USDA, National Statistics Service, 1992). This shift in dairy production has left land available for row crop production. With less perennial forage crops needed in the rotation, the cropping system has become one of continuous corn. Corn acres have increased 48% from 1987 to 2012 with 63,966 acres of corn planted in Trempealeau County in 1987 and 94,597 acres of corn for silage and grain in 2012 (USDA, National Statistics Service, 1992, 2012). No-till planting carries a yield penalty with continuous corn, so tillage is performed to maintain yields (Wolkowski et al., 2009). Methods to increase soil health and increase crop yields are needed in Trempealeau County. Program priority #2 will address these issues in the county.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
20|Aquatic Invasive Species Outreach|Aquatic invasive species (AIS) negatively impact Wisconsin through their ability to harm aquatic ecosystems, the economic value of those ecosystems, and human health. During 2019, the updated Wisconsin Aquatic Invasive Species Management Plan will be approved by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the national Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force. The updated plan is focused on the pathways AIS take into Wisconsin's waterbodies, such as organisms in trade, non-recreational fishing and aquaculture, and those who recreate in state waters as well and those who provide services where they touch lakes, rivers, and wetlands. Our AIS Outreach staff are working closely with WDNR Monitoring staff to identify how AIS are moving into and throughout the state, further developing our AIS picture, and in turn, helping the WI AIS Partnership develops actions to reduce the number propagules in transport.New and updated communication tools and outreach strategies will be needed to further the work the state has already accomplished to prevent AIS introductions through primary and secondary invasion pathways and to contain and control AIS that are already present. UW-Extension will play an important role in creating these tools and strategies and putting them into the hands of members of our AIS Prevention Network. As we learn more about each of the pathways of AIS, appropriate outreach methods will need to be developed and introduced to the partnership and directly to those engaged in specific pathways.|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
21|Aquatic Invasive Species Outreach|The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR), members of the AIS Partnership Network and volunteers store collected data in the WDNR's Surface Water Integrated Management System (SWIMS). The online database is used to collect a wide range of water related data for the state, including AIS monitoring reports, purple loosestrife biocontrol projects, stream and lake AIS signage projects, and other work that is often a deliverable of a WDNR AIS Education, Prevention and Planning grant. WDNR and partnership staffs are only recently learning how the database is useful beyond the collection of basic data. For each grant or project, it can contain the history of activities from project start to finish and include items such as personnel/project roles, specific work locations/actions, documents varying from press releases to final reports and maps, and AIS monitoring results that are fed directly to public facing webpages, including interactive maps. Beyond data collection, SWIMS acts as a work planning tool. The original SWIMS data manager left their position in early 2017. Various SWIMS project creation roles have been taken on by both WDNR Central Office and Regional staff, but no one had taken leadership of training WDNR AIS Coordinators or the AIS partners to use and manage the specific projects for the partnership. Working with staff from the Lakes and Rivers Section of the WDNR, I began developing training and piloting it in 2017 with two new AIS Coordinators from a grant funded partner and the WDNR AIS Coordinator who assists them. This educational effort will continue in 2019 to be expanded to new partners and additional WDNR staff. Because of my experience with the database as an AIS Coordinator and Monitoring Specialist with the WDNR, I'm in a unique position to provide this as a UW Extension educator. It is projected that by late 2019, SWIMS 2.0 will be out of production and ready for use. I anticipate assisting with training plans for the roll out in regards to AIS components.|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
22|Dairy and Livestock Management (2019)|Background information on Juneau County's part in the Central Wisconsin Agriculture Specialization (CWAS), which is a formal agreement with Adams, Green Lake, Marquette, Portage, Waushara, and Wood Counties. The Juneau County educator will mainly be focusing on creating educational programs and services that relate to dairy and crops in Juneau County as well as the six counties listed above. Each of the specialized agents in Adams, Green Lake, Marquette, Portage, Waushara, and Wood Counties have a topic area that they specialize in and create programs and services that go with their particular agriculture education fields: Adams offers agronomy and nutrient management; Green Lake offers commercial horticulture and nutrient management; Marquette offers livestock management; Portage offers vegetable production; Waushara offers farm business management; Wood offers dairy and cranberry production. In the beginning of 2019, the Waushara position was recently filled with a LTE position by the county, but there has been additional requests for time on the Adams, Green Lake, Juneau, Marquette, Portage, and Wood counties agriculture educators to help address local needs.In Juneau and Sauk Counties, on an annual basis, agriculture provides $348.6 billion (19.2% in Juneau Co.) and $865.3 million (13.8% in Sauk Co.) in each county's economic activity and $96.6 million (11.7% in Juneau Co.) and $331 million (10.4% in Sauk Co.) in each county's total income. Agriculture in Juneau County provides for 1,713 jobs (14.1%) of the county's workforce out of the 12,134 jobs as of 2014. In comparison, Sauk County Agriculture provides 5,463 jobs (11.7%) out of 46,653 jobs as of 2014.Note: The Juneau and Sauk Counties Educator has only transitioned to this 50/50 split position between the two county offices in mid-October. During this transition, the Educator has been trying to get to know key agriculture contacts in the counties and trying to get to know the county's needs. Meanwhile, hosting a few key programs this winter for certifications and licenses needed by the farmers.Just a reminder that there has not been a formal needs assessment done in a number of years for both counties and is a goal for the agricultural educator position this year. Making it difficult to determine the exact needs for the dairy and livestock industries. However, by going off of the 2012 census, milk was the first and second top selling commodity for Juneau and Sauk Counties. There is also 13 dairy product processing plants between the two counties and accounts for $92.1 million to Juneau County's economy and $348.9 million into Sauk County's economy. In comparison, livestock numbers for the counties show that livestock is an important part of the industry as well with cattle & calves placing in third and fourth top commodities for the two counties. Furthermore, hogs and pigs are ranked fourth for Sauk County's top commodities and ranks second in the state for hog and pig animal numbers. The 2012 Census of Agriculture states that Juneau is at 38% and Sauk County is at 66% for the market value of products sold. Making these important topics to look at and begin to create programming for in 2019. Reminder that in the beginning of 2019, Waushara had recently hired a LTE position, still placing additional requests for time on the Adams, Green Lake, Juneau, Marquette, Portage, and Wood counties agriculture educators to help address local needs in the CWAS area.|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

24|Field Crop Management|Scott Reuss serves as the Crops/Soils/Horticulture Agent for Marinette and Oconto Counties, through his role as Marinette County Agriculture/Horticulture Agent and an agricultural specialization agreement with Oconto County. The agricultural economic outlook for 2019 is still very poor for dairy producers, and unclear for grain producers. Dairy producers will struggle to maintain their operational viability, and will need to make forage management decisions that optimize their return on investment and achieve maximum forage quantity and/or quality. Included in these decisions will likely be re-plant or supplementation planting of perennial forage acres due to the winter die-back experienced in 2018 and also poor overwintering conditions at current. This adds even more economic stress and forage quality/quantity uncertainty to all area livestock producers. Grain producers have the constant challenge of managing costs while maintaining yield potential. Projected 2019 breakeven yields for grain crops are higher than long-term county averages (accounting for increasing yield trends) would indicate we will be able to produce. One educational need that will be addressed in 2019 is producer decision-making regarding Farm Service Agency programs made available to producers through the new Farm Bill. All producers will need to make decisions regarding their grain crop acres and UW-Extension will play a pivotal role in helping them understand the potential outcomes of that decision. Regarding nutrient management and soil health, a distinct opportunity for higher level programming is now available in the two-county area due to funding received through the Natural Resources Conservation Service for a sub-watershed improvement program (North Branch of the Little River). This NWQI (National Water Quality Initiative) effort will involve UW-Extension personnel taking a lead in producer education efforts surrounding the conservation efforts that can be cost-shared for implementation. 2019 is the first year of this 5-year effort.The desired outcomes in this plan of work are based on continuing local needs assessment via producer/agent interactions and the needs assessment surveys conducted in Oconto & Marinette (2014) and Shawano (2013) Counties. In those needs assessments, Shawano County producers indicated that their four highest educational topic needs related to: Grain Crops Pest Management; Soil Quality; Forage Crops Nutrient Management; and Forage Crops Pest Management. Oconto/Marinette County producers were asked to focus on dairy and livestock-oriented educational topic needs, but did indicate forage crop production information is still needed. They also indicated that the single most important role of UW-Extension within agricultural education is the education of non-agricultural citizenry. The second most important is to be a consistent source of information for producers, especially on a one-on-one basis. The specific activities within the outcomes listed below will be supplemented by agricultural newsletter articles, local newspaper articles, local radio shows, and electronic media information availability. In addition to the primary local educational roles, Reuss also serves on the state-wide Produce Safety Rule training team. In this role, he will be working with other UW-Extension and WI Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection staff to train & certify producers in the Produce Safety Alliance producer course and also conduct On-farm Readiness Reviews. This role will consume approximately 10-15% of his time in 2019, but is not spelled out in specifics here, as it is a state-wide initiative.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
25|Farm Management 2019-2020|Multiple years of negativecash flow have many farmers and lenders evaluating options. Selling less productive land to non-farmersis one option, but could lead to more unplanned non-farm development and morerural landowner conflicts in the future. Low net farm income often brings more demand for information about cashlease, as well as buying or selling standing crops. The new USDA Farm bill also includes newrisk management tools for farmers.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
26|Commercial Horticulture 2019|There are four different groups in Monroe County and surrounding area who are the target audience for commercial horticulture programming that I am part of. One of the groups is the cranberry growers, who have historically interacted directly with the specialists at UW. Occasionally I will get a call from them and will respond as needed. Fresh Market Vegetable and Fruit growers is another of the audiences. This group is primarily Amish, and I have worked with them for many years to help them with their crops. They primarily grow fresh market vegetables and flowers and bedding plants. They have become accomplished growers and the educational needs there have become more problem specific rather than basic production education like it was when they started. They grow a wide range of fresh market vegetables. Feedback from them has indicated that UW Extension is a highly valued resource for information. A current need for some Amish communities in the area is Food Safety and Modernization Act Training and Certification.Hops production in Wisconsin has had a great resurgence in the last 10 years as small craft brewers have increased their interest in Wisconsin produced hops to appeal to customers who appreciate local grown and local sourced foods and beverages. The hops growers have had to learn as they go because the majority of the current information on growing hops is from the Pacific northwest. One area of production I have helped to begin to address is that many acres of the hops are grown in coarse textured soils and nutrient leaching to groundwater is a concern on those soils. Hops growers do not want to be over fertilizing due to both environmental concerns and economic concerns. There are many other aspects of hops production that the group also assists with. We received a USDA Specialty Crop Block Grant to continue and expand the nitrogen rate trials for hops production in Wisconsin.The Ho-Chunk Native American Tribe has farm property in Monroe County and other counties as well and they are using the property near Tomah to begin to build and expand their Agriculture Division projects. They want to utilize their farm land for better opportunities than renting it out to other farmer to help provide better choices of food to tribal members, than what many of them, who are low income, may be able to get otherwise. I have worked with them for the past 4 years to help identify opportunities and implement a community garden in one of their housing subdivisions near Tomah. In late 2017 they set up funding for an Agriculture Division to begin additional larger scale fresh vegetable production projects at their Whirling Thunder Ranch property near Tomah.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
27|Farm Transitions (2019)|Building from previous year's plan of work I am going to continue to build up a rapport with local agriculture and horticulture groups. This past year I was able to attend several meetings of various stakeholders and gained a better understanding of their needs. The meetings, along with the needs assessment survey I conducted this past year are driving the programming I am continuing to do in La Crosse County. Data indicates the top five programs survey participants would like to see include Farm Succession, New Farm Technology, Sustainable Farming, Environmental Protection, and Animal Health. Since all of these require a shift in farming practices my major focus will be on Farm Transitioning which will include programming such as shifting gears, estate planning, BQA, YQCA, and much more.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
28|UW Diiscovery Farms (2019)|Situation statement (Why)University of Wisconsin-Madison Division of Extension is uniquely positioned to supply the technical expertise to educate citizens of Wisconsin on current issues and supply research on needed topics. UW Discovery Farms develops on-farm and related research to determine the economic and environmental effects of agricultural practices on a diverse group of Wisconsin farms; and educates and improves communications among the agricultural community, consumers, researchers and policymakers to better identify and implement effective environmental management practices that are compatible with profitable agriculture.Wisconsin has tremendous diversity in both the landscapes that are used for agricultural production as well as the types of animal and cropping systems. Therefore, practices to mitigate agriculture's potential impact to the environment will not only vary regionally, but also between different farms within a region or even between different fields on a farm. Understanding the timing and mechanisms for soil and nutrient loss from the diverse farming systems throughout Wisconsin will empower farmers, agricultural consultants and conservation professionals to determine effective, site-specific practices to protect Wisconsin's water resources while maintaining profitable agricultural production.The primary focus of UW Discovery Farms is to develop and implement research to more accurately assess water impairment sources, collaborate to develop effective practices to mitigate impairments, and educate stakeholders on methods to protect Wisconsin's water resources. It is vital that UW Extension engages in water quality issues as it has continued to become a developing problem at the local, state and national level. Water quality issues affect all populations, forms of business, recreation and tourism and have no civil rights factors and implications.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

30|Beef and Dairy Management 2019|Livestock production, in particular beef and dairy, is a significant part of agriculture in Monroe County. The volatile markets over the past 4 years have continued to make very tight margins in many agricultural enterprises. We continue to see dairy producers exit the dairy business, some transition from dairy enterprises to beef enterprises, cash crop only or no longer actively engage in farming. The landscape in Monroe and surrounding counties is such that perennial forage production (cattle feed) is necessary for good land stewardship. The need for Quality Assurance Certification Training livestock packers demand it continues to grow. The need to provide programming for beef producers has been identified and supported in this area by beef producers, ag lenders, veterinarians, and producer organizations through their participation, financial support and willingness to partner on educational efforts to provide unbiased, research based information to address local needs.Dairy producers have begun to increase the use of beef semen on varying percentages of their dairy cows in an effort in add value to calves they do not intend to keep for replacements in the dairy herd. A survey was conducted in 2018 to determine management practices used and where there may be some need for improvement of those management practices. The results will be used to determine potential educational opportunities in that area.I intend to work with my counterparts in nearby counties to help offer educational programming to address local needs for dairy producers. Some dairy and livestock producers will also need information to help them determine if they should continue to farm or look at transitioning out of livestock enterprises and or farming due to the continued sour farm economy.|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
31|Dairy Production and Management|"""Agriculture works hard for Manitowoc County every day. Family-owned farms, food processors and agriculture-related businesses generate thousands of jobs and millions of dollars of economic activity while contributing to local income and tax revenues. Manitowoc County is an agricultural powerhouse. The county is home to about 110,000 dairy cattle compared to approximately 81,000 people. Dairy farms of all sizes dot the rural landscape. Herd sizes range from fewer than 20 cows to more than 5,000 cows per farm. Located along Lake Michigan, the cool summer temperatures are ideal for milk production. As a leading dairy producer, Manitowoc County routinely ranks in the top five Wisconsin counties and the top 25 U.S. counties in dairy production. It also ranks in the top five Wisconsin counties in corn silage, hay, and winter wheat production. Manitowoc County agriculture provides 5,105 jobs, or about 11.5 percent, of the county's workforce of 44,370. Production jobs include farm owners and managers and farm employees. Agricultural service jobs include veterinarians, crop and livestock consultants, feed, fuel and other crop input suppliers, farm machinery dealers, barn builders and agricultural lenders, to name a few. Processing jobs include those employed in food processing and other value-added industries that support food processors. Every job in agriculture generates an additional 0.48 jobs in the county.Agriculture contributes $360 million to county income Manitowoc County agriculture accounts for $360.4 million, or 10 percent, of the county's total income. This includes wages, salaries, benefits and profits of farmers and workers in agriculture-related businesses. Every dollar of agricultural income generates an additional $0.49 of county income.Agriculture pumps $1.5 billion into local economy Manitowoc County agriculture generates $1.5 billion in economic activity, about 17 percent, of the county's total economic activity. Every dollar of sales from agricultural products generates an additional $0.16 of economic activity in other parts of the county's economy.The direct effect of agriculture equals$1.3 billion and includes the sale of farm products and value-added products.Purchases of agricultural and food processing inputs, services and equipment add another $129 million in economic activity. For example, this includes business-to-business purchases of fuel, seed, fertilizer, feed and farm machinery, as well as veterinary services, crop and livestock consultants and equipment leasing. This business-to-business activity then generates another $75.6 million in economic activity when people who work in agriculture-related businesses spend their earnings in the local economy.The 2017 average production per cow was 27,800 pounds tying Manitowoc County for first place in Wisconsin with Brown County. Furthermore, only Fond du Lac and Clark County dairy farmers produced more milk. Manitowoc County surpassed Dane County in 2017 to rank 3rd in the state in total milk production. Manitowoc County ranks third out of the 72 counties and in the top 25 counties in the U.S. in total annual milk production. In addition, Manitowoc County is tied for third with Dane County for the most dairy cows---55,000.Issues needing to be addressed in 2019 and beyond (Based on my experiences):Farmers have faced sustained low milk and commodity prices for the past four and one half years, making it difficult to meet the challenges of paying expenses. The December Class III milk price was $13.78 per cwt, the second lowest in 2018 (Only February's $13.40 per cwt was lower). This price equates to about $3 to $4 per cwt below the cost of production for the average Manitowoc County dairy farmer.Dairy farmers are being dropped by their milk processors if they do not meet certain parameters including animal comfort (tethered calves) and milk quality.There is a critical need for extension programming in the areas of farm succession (business transfer, retirement planning, and estate planning).There is a critical need for extension programming in the area of ""gracefully"" exiting the dairy industry.With the second highest inventory of heifers on record in the U.S. and with the cost of raising dairy calves and heifers exceeding the cost to purchase, farmers are looking for ways to be more efficient and profitable in raising the dairy replacement herd. Dairy farmers are looking at options to raising their own heifers.Manure management continues to be a major issue facing dairy farmers, custom manure haulers, and agronomists.Surface and groundwater protection is critical.Agricultural literacy needs to be addressed on a continual basis.When it comes to managing a dairy business operation, herd health, animal well-being, and sound financial management can have a substantial impact on profitability. Based on the 2011 needs assessment and emerging issues that I deal with on a daily basis, I will conduct programs for the 2019 program timeframe to help improve farm profitability via two program priorities: dairy production and management and farm business management. I will also devote a lot of time to agricultural literacy through the Farm Wisconsin Discovery Center as well as manure management and water quality related issues."|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

33|Youth Leadership|Situation Statement:Youth leadership development programs provide skill development and the opportunity to apply applying learned leadership skills. University of Illinois Extension (Diaz et al, 2015) has identified six action areas where youth leaders develop competency in 4-H Youth Development: 1) planning, 2) promoting, 3) teaching, 4) mentoring, 5) advocating, and 6) advising. Program examples and outcomes in each of these six areas were highlighted in a 2016 Wisconsin 4-H impact report: https://fyi.uwex.edu/4h/files/2014/06/2016-Wisconsin-4-H-Foundational-Topics-Report.pdfThe 2010 Wisconsin 4-H Youth Leadership study found that all older 4-H youth demonstrated individual growth in life skills, youth participating in the program's intentional leadership practices (club officers, committee members, camp counselors, leadership training workshop participants, teen court panelists, etc.) had more opportunities in group and teamwork development. Intentional leadership activities give many opportunities to lead and work with both youth and adults. The study identified key program practices that contributed to leadership skill development, including:  Youth are working on meaningful issues and have significant responsibilities Program structure provides a scaffold for youth leadership Shared vision and commitment fosters teamwork Youth/adult partnershipThe strongest outcomes in the 2010 Wisconsin 4-H study were in community connectedness and self-efficacy (beliefs about one's capabilities to produce effects). The strongest skill outcomes were related to communication, decision-making and problem-solving skills.|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1
34|Addressing Rural Broadband 2019 |"During the course of 2018 I sought to engage business owners for feedback in Forest and Vilas Counties as often as I could. Coordinating with the Vilas County Economic Development Director, I conducted 23 business retention visits in eastern Vilas County as a follow up to the survey of 150 businesses that I had done in 2017. I engaged economic development boards of both Vilas and Forest County - including directors, board members and business people as often as possible to gather input on their thoughts about business and economic development. I helped a private citizen - along with a small team - to prepare and hold an event we collectively called the Northwoods Forum, which attracted 88 people, to discuss economic development issues common to Forest, Vilas and Oneida Counties. From all of these gatherings and 'listening sessions' of the people in the region, two major topics emerged that I feel I can contribute much to the region by addressing: workforce development and broadband. The second issue where we need to continue to make major improvements is on broadband. The status of our broadband - or diminished capacity thereof, has once again been brought up by Vilas County Supervisors and government officials directly to me and board members of economic development committees in this two-county region. I write ""again"" because I was heavily involved in the strategy to increase broadband deployment from 2013-2017 in Vilas County. It seems that in the last two years there was almost a respite on this subject while people waited for federally-funded providers (under Connect America Funds) to deploy fiber and wireless broadband in these two counties (as elsewhere in rural regions of Wisconsin). But there has been a ""revival"" of interest, a ""re-wakening"" - as UW-Extension s The importance of the workforce issue was captured in the statewide Situational Analysis conducted in 2018 by UW-Extension.se Broadband Coordinator Gail Huycke recently stated in an email message to me ""It's almost like everybody wok up on January 1 [2019} and wanted more broadband. IN January, Northland Pines School District Administrator called me to talk about Broadband. Three local economic development committees in Vilas and Forest Counties have also picked up the drumbeat of seeking information relevant to improving their local broadband service. Thus, Preparing a Strategy to Improve the Quality of Rural Broadband is Major Program #2."|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
35|Crops and Soils Management|Agriculture in Chippewa County is vital to the overall county economy. In 2014, it was estimated Chippewa County agriculture contributes $618 million in economic activity and $205 million in total income. Agriculture also provides jobs for 3,387 Chippewa County residents. Over 1700 farms are located in Chippewa County according to the USDA 2012 Census of Agriculture. These farms average 219 acres in size. Horticulture contributes another $1 million in economic activity in the county with fruit crop and other specialty crops leading the way. Major crops grown in Chippewa County include corn (90,000 acres), soybean (50,000 acres, and alfalfa (25,000 acres). With a variety of agriculture and horticulture in Chippewa County, it is my intent to deliver programs in the areas of agronomy, soil and manure management, and horticulture.A Chippewa County Agriculture Needs Assessment Survey in 2015 revealed nutrient management as a top priority. Farmers indicated a need for improved nutrient management and utilization of on-farm nutrient sources in order to reduce input costs and increase profitability. Farmers will continue to seek out information and methods to better manage crop input costs as commodity prices in 2018 are forecasted to remain low and below a profitable range for many farms. Custom manure applicators and dairy and livestock producers remain interested in gaining information about new manure handling technology and safety. Demand for safety training and information has increased in response to recent farm accidents. Safety related to manure gases and manure handling equipment will be addressed through workshops and field meetings.Cover crops are being planted on several farms in Chippewa County as a result of an increased awareness of soil health and erosion benefits. NRCS has provided cost-sharing to farmers to incentivize and implement the practice of using cover crops. With limited cover crop data on Chippewa County soils and climate, the need for applied research to determine best management practices for cover crops and their benefits and challenges is needed. Commodity prices are projected to remain low in 2018 and some farmers are looking to alternative crops to provide additional income. Malting barley, hops, and industrial hemp have all peaked interest as alternative crops. UW-Extension is positioned to help farmers make decisions regarding these crops. Industrial hemp will only be addressed by this agent if approval to participate in the pilot research project from DATCP is secured.Chippewa County is home to 257 dairy farms, 26,000 milking cows, over 350 beef farms, and 4,500 head of beef cattle. The dairy industry remains the number one agricultural industry in Chippewa County and forage production is vitally important to milk production. Dairy and forage producers continue to put high quality forage as a priority for their farms. Alfalfa, hay, and corn silage production are top priorities for dairy and beef producers. The need for sound forage production and input management remains especially important. Forage production components including establishment, fertilization, pest management, and harvest and storage need to be addressed. Horticulture contributes over $1 million in economic activity to Chippewa County. Fruit crops, greenhouses, and fresh market enterprises make up a majority of the industry. Pest management is a major time commitment and production expense for these industries. Industrial hemp was approved for planting in Wisconsin in 2017 and included in the 2018 Farm Bill signed in December 2018. Farmers and land owners interested in planning industrial hemp have little to no local research and data to make decisions to grow the crop. Plans are to collaborate with Extension UW-Madison researchers and DATCP to provide a research location in Chippewa County.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
36|Dairy Production Management (2019)|"Fond du Lac County Agriculture & Dairy Industry: ""Agriculture works hard for Fond du Lac County every day. Family-owned farms, food processors and agriculture-related businesses generate thousands of jobs and millions of dollars of economic activity while contributing to local income and tax revenues. Fond du Lac County agriculture encompasses a mix of family farms, food processors, equipment manufacturers, retail and service providers. Dairy farms of all sizes dominate the rural landscape, ranging from fewer than 100 cows to more than 8,000.Fond du Lac County agriculture provides 7,790 jobs, or 13.6 percent, of the county's workforce of 57,293. Production jobs include farm owners, managers, and employees. Agricultural service jobs include veterinarians, crop and livestock consultants, feed, fuel and other crop input suppliers, farm machinery dealers, barn builders and agricultural lenders, to name a few. Processing jobs include those employed in food processing and other value-added industries that support food processors. Every job in agriculture generates an additional 0.73 jobs in the county. Agriculture contributes $591 million to county income Fond du Lac County agriculture accounts for $591.3 million, or 13.3 percent, of the county's total income. This includes wages, salaries, benefits and profits of farmers and workers in agriculture-related businesses. Every dollar of agricultural income generates an additional $0.79 of county income. Agriculture pumps $2.2 billion into local economy Fond du Lac County agriculture generates $2.2 billion in economic activity, about 21 percent, of the county's total economic activity. Every dollar of sales from agricultural products generates an additional $0.27 of economic activity in other parts of the county's economy. Here's how agriculture stimulates economic activity:  The direct effect of agriculture equals $1.75 billion and includes the sale of farm products and value-added products.  Purchases of agricultural and food processing inputs, services and equipment add another $316.7 million in economic activity. For example, this includes business-to-business purchases of fuel, seed, fertilizer, feed and farm machinery, as well as veterinary services, crop and livestock consultants and equipment leasing.   This business-to-business activity then generates another $157.3 million in economic activity when people who work in agriculture-related businesses spend their earnings in the local economy""Dairying remains paramount to the success of agriculture in Fond du Lac County. Fond du Lac County's 223 dairy farms (a 14 farm loss from the previous year) house 59,000 dairy cows (rank 3rd in state for cow numbers) which produce 26,300 pounds per milk per cow per year. With a total milk production of 1.55 billion pounds of milk in Fond du Lac County, Fond du Lac County is the leading county in the state for total milk production (Wisconsin Agriculture Statics Service, 2017) and falling in the top 25 US dairy-producing counties. ""Dairy is a key Fond du Lac County industry Dairy farming is the major agricultural industry in Fond du Lac County. On-farm production and milk sales account for $239.6 million. Processing milk into dairy products generates another $1.02 billion.  Eleven plants process dairy products in Fond du Lac County.   On-farm milk production accounts for 1,119 jobs, and dairy processing accounts for 2,164 jobs.  At the county level, each dairy cow generates $3,645 in on-farm sales to producers.   At the state level, each dairy cow generates over $34,000 in total sales."" Source: S. Deller, 2014 Fond du Lac County Agriculture: Value & Economic Impact2017 Program Needs Assessment: With a hire of both the Dodge County dairy & livestock agent, and the Fond du Lac/Dodge County area crops & soils agent, a joint needs assessment of both counties' farmers and agri-business community was conducted Winter 2016-2017 to identify programming priorities in the areas of dairy and agronomy. The needs assessment was distributed to extension meeting participants, as well as via email with an online survey. Based on the needs assessment (n=100), the following top educational dairy replated priorities were identified:  Nutrition ? Reproduction Animal well-being ? HousingCurrent & Emerging Issues: The dairy industry is a very dynamic industry, with new technologies and practices being developed, managing income and expenses with an ever-changing market, and an aging population.  Dairy farmers faced tight margins for the past couple years with 2019 milk prices predicted to be a better year, but still not good enough to support the farm families. The December Class III milk price was $13.78 per cwt, the second lowest in 2018. This price equates to about $3 to $4 per cwt below the cost of production for the average dairy farmer. With a large national dairy herd, declining domestic demand, reduced exports due to large global outputs of milk, and a strong dollar, prices for commodities such as milk are negatively affected. Lower milk checks means reduced income for the farm to pay expenses related to the farm business, as well as living expenses. Farmers have to watch more carefully on where they spend every dollar. With long-term low milk prices, farmers and their families are emotionally and mentally affected through stress. Many farms are exiting due to low milk prices, at a rate of over two farms per day state-wide.  Raising dairy replacement is the third largest expenditure on the farm in the production of milk, standing just behind feed costs and labor. The US dairy replacement herd continues to increase. In the 50+ years of reporting by USDA National Agriculture Statistics Service, the heifer inventory was the highest in 2016 and the second highest in 2017. With the cost of raising dairy replacement much higher than to purchase a replacement, there are opportunities to help farmer evaluate the opportunities to reduce costs in raising dairy replacements or to evaluate opportunities and risks to cull the heifer herd before a large investment is made.  Farm succession from one generation to the next can be overwhelming for families when added to the daily decisions necessary to run the farm. Farmers make decisions every day to improve their farm business and provide their family with a home and lifestyle they want for them. However, many of them have not planned for the family's and/or farm operation's long-term sustainability regarding farm succession and retirement. Based on USDA numbers, there are about 8,400 farms with operators between the ages of 45 and 64. Unfortunately, only an estimated one-third of these farms have a business succession plan in place. That means of the 8,400 farms, 5,600 farms will need some type of business succession or exit plan over the next few years (Source: J. Kirkpatrick presentation)When it comes to managing a dairy business operation, herd health, animal well-being, and sound financial management can have a substantial impact on profitability. Based on the educational priorities identified in the needs assessment as well as current and emerging issues within the overall dairy industry and community, this agent will conduct outreach for the 2018 programming year through two major program priorities: 1.) Dairy Production & Management and 2.) Farm Business Management. Please see the following Plan of Work for details."|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
37|Farm Succession (2019)|The average age of the Wisconsin farmer is ever increasing. To be frank the land will be changing ownership as the war generation and the senior boomers die off. The millennial generation has shown a strong interest in going into farming. They seem to be attracted to farming because of their environmental awareness, their distrust of the established food infrastructure, the quality of life, and the chance to be their own boss. The situation is that the value of the land has increased many times over since the current lands owning generation got into farming. The cost of living has increased at least to at least four times the value of the cost of living in the 70's. Farm gate prices are relatively the same as they were in 1979. Although production potential has gone up, the level of production from an acre of land or out of a dairy cow has only doubled. Land values have gone up as a response to Baby Boomers buying recreational property to retire to, development and urban sprawl, higher commodity prices from 2010 to 2014, and investors looking to diversify their portfolio. As a whole the generation who is interested in taking up farming as a career tend to have more education than the current land owning generation but in spite of their education they were hit hardest by the great recession. As a result they carry more debt than any other generation before them. This generation is also living under the realization that for the first time since the nineteen thirties their quality of living and lifetime earnings will be lower than the generations who came before. This has put them at a great disadvantage in obtaining the farming lifestyle that they would like to achieve. The reality for them is that to try to outright purchase enough land to have a viable farming enterprise will put them into more debt than they can sustain.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

Wisconsin 4-H Youth Development has over 9,650 volunteers who are enrolled as UW-Extension 4-H volunteers working with 30,000 youth enrolled in 4-H programs. In 2018, volunteers reported on average they donated over 58 hours per year. Approximately 72% of Wisconsin 4-H volunteers are female and 28% are male. Nationally, women continue to volunteer at a higher rate than men. (Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. Department of Labor.) In Wisconsin 4-H, approximately 97% of the volunteers are white. WI 4-H Youth Development volunteers currently do not reflect the demographics of most counties.In 2018, Sawyer County had 21 adult volunteers. The demographics of volunteers were 76.2 % female and 23.8% male with approximately 100% of the volunteers being white. Sawyer County demographics indicates there is a potential audience of volunteers who reflect 22 % Native American racial and ethnic group who are currently not volunteering in 4-H Youth Development.Volunteers play a critical role in the delivery of quality educational programs. In a survey completed January 2015, 4-H Youth Development staff identified Volunteer Development as an area in need of program support. Additionally, a WI 4-H Youth Development Survey was conducted in February 2014 of over 1500 volunteers. Adult volunteers in 4-H indicated relatively low awareness and understanding of some of the educational principles (Essential Elements and the Experiential Learning Process) that are central to the work of 4-H Youth Development. In the 2014 survey, volunteers expressed an interest in learning through not only face-to-face modalities; but also through online-learning such as webinars and podcasts. The 2017 Strategic Plan released by USDA NIFA and National 4-H Council outlines a 4-H Youth Development Vision for 2025. Nationally the following goal has been established ""Youth are surrounded with competent, prepared staff and volunteers."" This goal includes the following outcomes: ""The 4-H program is supported by a well-trained volunteer force."" ""4-H staff and volunteers engage in meaningful professional development.""In addition, there is a responsibility of volunteers to ensure access, equity and opportunity. The National 4-H Strategic goal states ""All youth engage in program and opportunities."" To that end it has been identified that ""4-H volunteers and staff are skilled, knowledgeable and prepared to work with all members of their community."" Sawyer County is devoted to offering high quality positive youth development programing to the youth in Sawyer County, these programs are offered with the support of the Sawyer County 4-H volunteers. Historically, in the last 5 years, Sawyer County has had limited critical leaders that have been volunteering for several years, fulfilling most of the volunteering roles and supporting new 4-H volunteers. Sawyer County 4-H program continues to recruit new skilled volunteers to offer learning experiences to Sawyer County youth that were not offered as a leader lead projects in the past. With this historical knowledge and perspective of 4-H and a new eagerness for providing more high quality positive youth development learning experiences, Sawyer County 4-H will need to provide more training opportunities/experiences to the volunteers."|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1
39|Community Gardens Program (2019)|Brown County's 2016 Leading Indicators for Excellence (LIFE) Study identified high rates of obesity, hunger disparities by income, and racial/ethnic inequality and exclusion as top opportunities for county improvement.[1] Community gardens offer the unique opportunity to impact all of these areas and, since 1996, the Brown County UW-Extension Community Gardens Program has provided gardening space to the community that helps to address and alleviate these concerns. Additionally, since its inception, the Community Gardens Program has especially worked to reach low-income and immigrant populations due to the particular health, food security, and community building concerns this population often faces. Brown County statistics indicate a need for both physical and mental health intervention. The County Health Rankings reports a 30% obesity rate in Brown County, with a negative projected trend for the future.[2] The Rankings also lists a physical inactivity rate of 19% and a shortage of mental health care providers in Brown County. Statistics are especially concerning for low-income and ethnic and racial minority populations, whose physical and mental health are frequently below those of higher income and white, non-Hispanic populations. The National Health Interview Survey, for example, reported some diet and exercise-related health problem rates for low-income families as more than twice the population's average.[3] Food security, as well as access to healthy food, is also of concern. The percentage of Brown County community members living in poverty increased from 10.9% for 2008-2012 to 11.7% for 2012-2016.[4] Additionally, the County Health Rankings rates each county's food environment based on food insecurity and healthy food access, and Brown County received a score of 8.4 out of 10, lower than the statewide average of 8.8. [2] Access to healthy food correlates closely to income and food security: A 2014 study of Brown County food pantry users found that 73% of respondents reduced their fruit and vegetable intake because of these items' cost, an increase from 69% in 2009. [3] Food security also varies by race and ethnicity the USDA reports some minority families often have less food security than the national average [5] as well as by gender, as females are more likely to be food insecure than males (in Brown County, 50% vs 34% of respondents to the Brown County Household Food Security Survey [3]).In 2018, over 210 families, 70% of whom self-identified as being of low or moderate income, rented one or more community garden plots at one of the Brown County UW-Extension Community Gardens Program's 10 garden sites. Approximately 40% self-identified as Asian, and 12% as Hispanic. Additionally, 32% were male and 61% female (with the remaining 7% not responding).Each fall, community gardeners are surveyed about the program's impact and any benefits provided. Participants routinely report positive program impacts, including increased fruit and vegetable consumption (90% of respondents [30% survey response rate] in 2018), more physical activity (89%), being more easily able to provide enough food for their families (79%), and meeting more people from cultures and backgrounds different from their own (67%). In addition, 2018 gardeners raised an estimated nearly $325,000 worth of produce, calculated by applying a USDA formula.[6] These outcomes indicate community gardens' effectiveness in reaching its community improvement goals by improving health, food security, community, and inclusiveness. All of these impacts create a healthier, more connected, and more functional society.Lastly, participating gardeners are asked annually to submit their ideal garden size, and each year gardeners request multiple acres of space beyond what the program currently provides. Furthermore, 39% of surveyed Brown County food pantry users reported in 2014 that having access to a gardening space would help them improve food access.[7] This indicates both the value of the current programming and the additional opportunities and expansion needed to fully meet community needs.

40|Green Industry Continuing Education|Green Industry (commercial horticulture) professionals in Wisconsin need continuing education to keep up with new developments, current trends and policies in the industry. Many industry members, such as professional arborists, also require continuing education units to meet and retain certification requirements in professional organizations such as the International Society of Arboriculture.

41|Emphasis on STEM|The Microsoft and 4-H Digital Ambassadors partnership empowers youth to help close the broadband internet gap. Currently in the U.S. there are 23.4 million people who lack broadband internet access. Access is only half of the problem; feeling secure and knowledgeable enough to adapt and use the technology is the other half. We will elevate teens as teachers to provide training and communication to assist adults in 80 communities across 13 states. The objective of the training will be to increase the comfort level of adults in the community around technology.|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1
42|Positive Youth Development Programing |"According to the United States Census Bureau in 2017, this demographic data was reported for Sawyer County. It states that Sawyer County has a population of 16,384 (White 77.9%, Black or African American .7%, American Indian and Alaskan Native 17.6%), with a median income of $43,565. Sawyer County Youth are expected to graduate or obtain higher education at a rate of 91.4%. 17.7% of Sawyer County families are living in poverty.There are 3 public schools and 3 private schools in the County. There is an estimated 3,104 youth 3 years and older living in Sawyer County. The United States Census Bureau in 2107 estimated that there were approximately 838 elementary youth, intermediate 712 youth and high school 767 youth. Many of the intermediate and high school youth from Winter, Lac Courte Orielles and Hayward took part in Sawyer County's Dose of Reality survey on risky behaviors specific to alcohol and other drug use in 2018. The youth indicated the following:  Do you think many youth your age drink alcohol? 67% stated Yes How much of a problem do you think drinking and driving is for youth? 50% stated a Big problem Do you think that many youth your age use tobacco products? 57% stated yes  Do you think that there are many youth your age who abuse prescription drugs? 37% stated Yes Do you think youth your age abuse more than on substance such as alcohol, marijuana, and prescription drugs at a time? 41% stated YesThe same youth were also surveyed on what ways would make kids their age stop drinking/using drugs and what types of activities could the community provide to prevent the types of risky teen behavior? hey stated that ""if there was something better to do like a sober event"", ""fun sober activities"", ""offer more in the community"", ""fun activities for free"", ""put on stuff like sports tournaments to keep kids away from drugs"" and ""having more stuff to do around for kids"". The Sawyer County youth voice clearly states they want more Positive Youth Development opportunities in their county. Research indicates that young people who are surrounded by a variety of opportunities for positive encounters engage in less risky behavior and ultimately show evidence of higher rates of successful transitions into adulthood.1PYD programs are one venue to ensure that young people have access to adequate positive opportunities. The available evidence suggests that PYD programs can prevent a variety of risk behaviors among young people and improve social and emotional outcomes."|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
43|4-H Tech Wizards|When considering the importance of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, many reports speak of job opportunities and economic drivers in a global environment. Research strongly suggests that STEM educational initiatives are not just creating scientists and engineers, but producing STEM literate persons in all areas of the workforce. Eighty percent of the fastest growing occupations in the U.S. require STEM adequacy, and science and technology jobs are projected to grow by 20.6 percent through 2020, more than doubling the 10.1 percent overall U.S. labor force's projected growth (Beatty, National Research Council Committee on Highly Successful Schools or Programs for K-12 STEM Education, National Research Council Board on Science Education, & National Research Council Center for Education, 2011). Additionally, in middle-skill jobs (jobs that require more than a high school diploma, but less than a four year degree), over 67% of openings require, at a minimum, proficiency in productivity software such as Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word and typically other digital literacy skills (Burning Glass Technologies, Captial One, 2015). Overall, it seems clear that middle-skills work has shifted decisively and is now digitally intensive.As a mission mandate, the impacts of STEM educational programming within 4-H have been investigated. Hershberg et al. found that youth in 4-H science programs were nearly two times more likely to participate in science, engineering and computer technology programs during OST (Grades 10 - 12). Additionally, girls who participate in 4-H are two times more likely (Grade 10) and nearly three times more likely (Grade 12) to take part in science programs compared to girls in other OST activities (Hershberg, DeSouza, Warren, Lerner, & Lerner, 2014). Other researchers state that STEM education within 4-H can improve science literacy (Smith, Heck, & Worker, 2012) and build problem solving skills (Daniels et al., 2013).|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1
44|Waukesha County Community Youth Garden |"A committee at the Waukesha County Department of Health and Human Services made up of representatives from the Waukesha County Juvenile Court, Waukesha County Human Services Department, Waukesha County Corporation Counsel, Wisconsin State Public Defenders Office, Waukesha County Bar Association Juvenile Law Section, public defenders, the judge presiding in the Waukesha County Juvenile Court System was looking for alternatives to sanctions for some of their youth offenders. For some youth, the committee felt placing them in a juvenile facility should not be the only option. They contacted me (Ann Wied) to discuss the possibility of having a youth garden as an alternative option. This garden would provide an alternative while also providing cost effective savings for taxpayers. This garden project would allow youth to forego potential sanctions, or placement in a juvenile facility, in favor of participating in the community garden project a minimum of 12, 90-minute sessions. Committee members thought that there would be value in a garden program because it would allow youth to experience healthy, educational activities in a natural environment that would help youth feel just like themselves and find a sense of peace. It would also give youth an opportunity to give back to the community as well. This was important because a significant percent of the youth that would participate in this program suffered from anxiety, social anxiety, or depression .In 2018, this youth garden program completed its third year. Several Waukesha County Health and Human Services Department Social Workers who regularly attended the program with their clients reflected on the program: ""The garden served a different purpose for each of my participants from my caseload, and the garden has a wide appeal. I also believe the garden was helpful for me to work and interact side by side with the kids and colleagues."" ""The youth participants formed connections, worked collectively and found meaning in helping to provide healthy food for the community of Waukesha."" ""The garden program was a great confidence booster for the youth we serve."" ""The Garden provided an emotionally supportive environment. The Staff working in the garden were extremely compassionate with the youth. Children were supported to work through their insecurities and feel successful."""|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
45|Volunteer Development|"Adult volunteers are Wisconsin 4-H's most valuable asset in delivering the quality youth-led, adult guided programs to support youth as they acquire essential life skills.

46|Expanding Access 2019|Situation Statement: Demographically, the United States continues to grow more diverse and this demographic trend is even more apparent nationwide with the youth population (Chart 1).Chart 1 (Child Trends, 2016)Wisconsin's racial minority population increased 500 percent between 1970 and 2013 including significant increases in Latino/Hispanic, Black/African American and Asian populations (Gordon, 2016). Similarly, the growing number of foreign-born youth and families provide opportunities for 4-H youth development to grow its membership base and reach new audiences. In 1990, census figures showed the foreign-born population at about 121,500; in 2015, that number had increased to nearly 279,000. This represents an increase of 130% over the 25 year span (Long, Jones, & and Ewald, 2017). These audiences are historically underserved by 4-H Youth Development. Families and individuals may lack familiarity with 4-H (knowledge barrier) or unable to access 4-H programs by traditional means (organizational barrier). 4-H Youth Development can benefit by welcoming youth and volunteers from diverse backgrounds. As an organization, UW-Extension needs diversity in its staff, volunteers and learners to effectively participate in an intercultural and global world.The 4-H Community Club program had 29,912 youth (grades 5K-13) enrolled in 2017. Of those youth enrolled in 4-H Community Clubs, 94.7% identified as White (4-H Youth Development State Office, 2018). Given that Wisconsin's population is 86% White according to Census 2010, it is clear that the community club program does not reflect the state's demographic profile (United States Census Bureau, 2010).In 2017, 10,787 adults had been certified as 4-H Youth Development volunteers of those 97.1% of these adults self-identified as White (4-H Youth Development State Office, 2018).In addition to the 4-H Community Club, 4-H Youth Development in Wisconsin offers programs for youth that include 4-H Afterschool programs, in-school enrichment programs, and group educational experiences at camps, demonstrations, library programs and more. In 2017, 27,392 youth participated in these experiences across the state and 82.3% of these youth were identified as White (4-H Youth Development State Office, 2018). Although gains have been made in delivering educational programs to underserved youth through these types of modalities, more effort must be made to provide racially and ethnically diverse 4-H participants with all the opportunities available through 4-H club programs, including staff support, awards, educational trips and scholarships.In April of 2016, National 4-H launched a new campaign aimed at rebranding 4-H as a strategy to increase the number of ethnically and racially diverse youth participating in the program. National 4-H has set their goal high. By 2025, 4-H wants to add 4 million new members and in so doing double the number of African American and Hispanic youth engaged in the program. This goal is especially pertinent in Wisconsin where the state's youth of color face extreme racial disparity across all measures of well-being and could benefit greatly from quality youth development programs. According to the 2016 KIDS COUNT Data Book, Wisconsin ranked 12th among the 50 states in overall child well-being, but persistent challenges hinder children living in immigrant families and children of color, especially African-American, Latinx and American Indian children (The Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2018; Kids Forward, 2018). Black children and American Indian children in Wisconsin are more than four times as likely to live in poverty as White non-Hispanic children, and Hispanic children are nearly three times as likely as White children (Kids Forward, 2018). In 2015, a 24/7 Wall Street Special Report listed Wisconsin as the worst state in the nation for Black Americans. Authors citied home ownership, unemployment, and incarceration rates as key indicators of extreme racial inequality (Frohlich, Sauter, & Stebbins, 2015). According to a 2002 study conducted at the Institute for Applied Research in Youth Development, Tufts University, researchers discovered that compared to their peers, youth involved in 4-H programs excel in several areas. 4-H Youth are: Four times more likely to make contributions to their communities (Grades 7-12); Two times more likely to be civically active (Grades 8-12);  Two times more likely to make healthier choices (Grade 7); Two times more likely to participate in Science, Engineering and Computer Technology programs during out-of-school time (Grades 10 - 12); and 4-H girls are two times more likely (Grade 10) and nearly three times more likely (Grade 12) to take part in science programs compared to girls in other out-of-school time activities (Tufts University).Adapting what works in 4-H Youth Development programming to the needs of emerging and underserved audiences is a major goal of the Expanding Access Team. We know from recent focus groups conducted with diverse stakeholders that parents are interested in these programs and willing to assist with programming in their communities. In April 2017, 4-H Youth Development was reviewed for Civil Rights Compliance by a team from NIFA-USDA (Hicks, 2017). The review was conducted to determine whether UWEX was complying with the provisions of the U.S. Civil Rights law and USDA's Civil Rights rules and regulations. The team found significant areas of improvement. Serious civil rights concerns include:  the ability to collect participant data inequitable access to participate in activities and opportunities supporting a diverse and inclusive volunteer base the absence of a strategic plan for expanding access the lack of a diverse and demographically representative advisory groupLocally in Waupaca County, the youth population has dropped from 11,450 youth ages 5-19 (Census 2000) to 10,077 youth ages 5-19 (Census 2010) or a 12% decrease. With these figures, the 4-H Community Club program has remained steady in enrollment. For 2019, there are 433 youth enrolled, with 435 enrolled in both 2017 and 2018. Adult volunteers enrolled this year are 211, up slightly from 204 in 2018 and 209 in 2017. Where we acknowledge some efforts need to be focused is on reaching parity in the Community Club program. According to Census 2010, 2.5% of the population of Waupaca County was Hispanic or Latino, this represents an 83.1% increase from Census 2000. Youth membership in 4-H currently includes 1.2% Hispanic or Latino individuals and 1.8% a race other than white. Three years ago, one Hispanic adult volunteer completed the training to become a certified 4-H leader. This volunteer has been an asset to our program with some help in promoting events and translating local brochures into Spanish (as two school districts requested for 4-H Day Camp brochures (up from 1 the year before). It is hoped that efforts will continue to build from here. As will be seen in thisplan of work, one particular school district in Waupaca County, Clintonville,has reached out to partner with UW-Extension and 4-H on some educationalopportunities. Partnerships such as this, or with other districts, can makeyouth and families more aware of the opportunities in 4-H and increaseenrollment and opportunities for all youth. According to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction DistrictReport Card for 2017-2018, the Clintonville School District in Waupaca Countyhas the highest percentage of students reported as races other than white, thanany other district in the county. Thewhite student population is 82.1% (decrease from 2016-2017) and theHispanic/Latino student population is recorded as 13.1% (almost 2% more thanlast year). There are also almost  ofthe students recorded as economically disadvantaged. Economic diversity across Waupaca County is veryprevalent and some response steps later in this plan will show efforts tobridge some of the financial burdens for participation.|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1

Research has shown that the lost of family farms in rural areas have had significant effects in depressing rural communities. During this same time, Wisconsin's local foods movement has demonstrated a desire for wholesome, local foods. I contend that the time is ripe for a local dairy movement that revisits Europe's continuing tradition of on-farm processing of milk into products that can be marketed directly by the farmer and result in a economically feasible farm business.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
49|Dairy Farm Profitability|Overall Situation StatementOutagamie County is home to a large population of 180,430 people. The large urban population is mostly centered in the Fox Cities and the surrounding area. The rural areas are close by, just minutes in any direction. We have a thriving agricultural county, whereas in 2016 we had 37,000 cows producing 27,500 pounds of milk per cow. This rates our county in the top 10 milk producing counties in Wisconsin. In 2016, we had a total of 204 herds of dairy cattle, 95% being grade A.Because of this great agriculture base, we have many food processors and agricultural related businesses, which help support our communities, by generating thousands of jobs and millions of dollars of business. Our county residents enjoy the positive impact this has on their household income and local tax revenues. We are diversified in race and ethnicity with residents being 88.6% white, 3.93% Hispanic, 3.19% Asian, 1.57% native, and 1.47% of more than one ethnicity. Spanish is the most common foreign language with 5,489 speakers, followed by a large Hmong population of 3,192 speakers. In 2014, 85.9% of our farms were owned by individuals or families, 7.0% of our farms were owned by family partnerships, 4.9% of our farms were owned by family-owned corporations, and lastly 2.2% of our farms were owned by non-family corporations. Our county is largely family owned farms. The UW-Extension Outagamie County Dairy/Livestock Educator' main programming will focus on dairy, with additional programming reaching out to the needs of the livestock owners. In addition to the species specific programming needs, the general agriculture community will benefit from programming or educational material presented on dairy farm profitability, livestock producer education, and possibly programming on farm stress and farm succession. Along with programming, I reach out to the community, and bring agricultural awareness and education as much as possible. We are at a time in history, whereas most people are 50 years removed from agriculture. To preserve our agriculture lands and lifestyle, I reach out and teach the public about agriculture, answer questions, giving all opportunities to see, touch, smell, and hear everything on a farm. The primary production agriculture focus will be on milk quality, farm modernization or expansion, farms and roads, farm safety, farm profitability and farm succession. I will work with dairy and livestock farms and focus on their specific needs.

51|Tile Drainage and Soil Health Research|Water quality is a concern in the agriculture sector. Agricultural nutrient losses are the driver of algal blooms and hypoxia in both fresh and salt water systems. One of the pathways for nutrient loss from agricultural fields is tile drainage. Previous tile drainage water quality studies conducted by Discovery Farms have shown tile drainage to be a source of nitrate loss and a potential source of dissolved phosphorous loss from Wisconsin agricultural fields. Soil health has become a recent focus in agriculture and numerous articles can be found in recent farming publications. NRCS has emphasized the importance of soil health and has built a team of educators, as well as allocated cost share dollars, to helping farmers improve their soil health. The soil health initiative has the potential to improve soil and water quality and make farmers more productive and sustainable. However, there is still much debate about how to measure soil health. There is also a lack of widespread evidence that healthy soils improve water quality. Discovery Farms is currently implementing a study to evaluate tile water quality and soil health. Farmers' financial well-being is affected by the efficiency that they produce their crops and reduced nutrient losses can improve efficiency.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
52|Green Industry Education (2019)|The Green Industry in Wisconsin is strong and growing, providing services and products to the ever expanding urban public. There is an increasing need for continuing education by the green industry professionals, including all ranks of employees within horticultural businesses and government entities. From managers and supervisors to maintenance staff and technicians, all parties need to be kept informed of trends, policies, and procedures in the ever-changing nature of the industry. Green Industry practices improve the environment by conserving resources, reduce chemical applications, save labor costs and improve the safety and health of the employees. Extension has been a leader in providing educational opportunities and advice to green industry professionals for years, and employers count on Extension to assist in providing educational conferences, workshops, and training for employees. Many professional organizations require continuing education units to meet and retain certification requirements, and Extension programs help serve these needs.https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes373011.htmTo achieve success in this program:Educators work cooperatively to arrange and host educational sessions for employees in the commercial, public and private sectors of the green industry. This may include landscapers, grounds maintenance technicians, arborists, nurserymen, municipal and government employees, landscape designers and architects. Educators support each other by sharing programs throughout the state, developing partnerships, and creating networks between Extension staff, horticultural businesses, municipalities, government agencies and other institutions of higher learning.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
53|Crop and Soils Management (2019)|Background information on Juneau County's part in the Central Wisconsin Agriculture Specialization (CWAS), which is a formal agreement with Adams, Green Lake, Marquette, Portage, Waushara, and Wood Counties. The Juneau County educator will mainly be focusing on creating educational programs and services that relate to dairy and crops in Juneau County as well as the six counties listed above. Each of the specialized agents in Adams, Green Lake, Marquette, Portage, Waushara, and Wood Counties have a topic area that they specialize in and create programs and services that go with their particular agriculture education fields: Adams offers agronomy and nutrient management; Green Lake offers commercial horticulture and nutrient management; Marquette offers livestock management; Portage offers vegetable production; Waushara offers farm business management; Wood offers dairy and cranberry production. In the beginning of 2019, the Waushara position was recently filled with a LTE position by the county, but there has been additional requests for time on the Adams, Green Lake, Juneau, Marquette, Portage, and Wood counties agriculture educators to help address local needs.In Juneau and Sauk Counties, on an annual basis, agriculture provides $348.6 billion (19.2% in Juneau Co.) and $865.3 million (13.8% in Sauk Co.) in each county's economic activity and $96.6 million (11.7% in Juneau Co.) and $331 million (10.4% in Sauk Co.) in each county's total income. Agriculture in Juneau County provides for 1,713 jobs (14.1%) of the county's workforce out of the 12,134 jobs as of 2014. In comparison, Sauk County Agriculture provides 5,463 jobs (11.7%) out of 46,653 jobs as of 2014.Note: The Juneau and Sauk Counties Educator has only transitioned to this 50/50 split position between the two county offices in mid-October. During this transition, the Educator has been trying to get to know key agriculture contacts in the counties and trying to get to know the county's needs. Meanwhile, hosting a few key programs this winter for certifications and licenses needed by the farmers.Juneau County's top commodities are grain with $38.3 million in first place and vegetables is number fifth in top commodities with $8.2 million as of 2012. Grain sales account for 62% of market value of products sold by farms in Juneau County. In comparison to Sauk County, where grain sales account for 34% of the market value of products sold by farms. Sauk County's top commodities vary just slightly with grain coming in second with $62.7 million in sales and other crops & hay coming in fifth with $4.7 million in sales. The 2012 Census of Agriculture estimates that there are 374 farms using 19,491 acres in Juneau County and 900 farms handling 53,690 acres in Sauk County for forage uses (hay, haylage, etc.). The next largest grown product in Juneau and Sauk Counties is corn for grain with 339 farms operating 40,373 acres in Juneau County and 720 farms working 80,683 acres in Sauk County. The third largest product grown in Juneau and Sauk Counties is soybeans for beans with 196 farms utilizing 26,355 acres in Juneau County and 466 farms managing 30,025 acres in Sauk County.There has not been a formal needs assessment done in a number of years for either counties and is a goal for the agricultural educator position this year. Having an updated needs assessment will help with programming options in the county and learning more about the interests from the farmers/producers/growers. Also, the 2017 Ag Census should be able to shed more light on the new numbers for the county's agricultural statistics. Before being able to update the needs assessment it has been noted that the agriculture mailing list has not been updated in a number of years. Due to this we are working on updating these lists prior to the needs assessment being mailed out to the counties residents that are involved in agriculture. The Juneau and Sauk Counties Educator is wanting to reach as large and diverse of an audience in the agriculture industry as possible. Without an updated mailing list, it will not be possible to reach the wide array of individuals in the county that should be included and in return may skew the survey results. Another way the educator has been trying to assess the county needs is to look at the questions that are coming into the office this past year and pull out any duplicating interests that could be addressed and potentially be useful to a larger audience in the county.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
54|Animal Health and Well-Being (2019)|"Situation Statement:Agriculture in Oconto and Marinette Counties:Agriculture is a key contributor to Oconto and Marinette Counties' economy. According to ""Oconto County Agriculture: Value and Economic Impact"" (Deller, 2014), agriculture provides 4,193 jobs and $126.4 million to the county's income. Dairy is Oconto County's leading agricultural sector. In 2012, 154 dairy farms housing 20,100 dairy cows, contributed $97.3 million to the local economy in on-farm milk production and milk sales. In addition to dairy production; grain, cattle and calves, and vegetable production drive approximately $1.3 billion in economic activity in Oconto County (United States Department of Agriculture National Agriculture Statistics Survey (USDA NASS, 2012)). During the same time period, Marinette County had 66 dairy farms housing 11,800 dairy cows and contributing $55.1 million to the local economy in on-farm milk production and milk sales (USDA NASS, 2012).Oconto and Marinette Counties have a formal specialization agreement allowing the county's agriculture agents to specialize in dairy and livestock (Oconto County) or agronomy and horticulture (Marinette County). The agents collaborate on educational programming where appropriate. The specialization agreement provides farmers, home gardeners, and agribusinesses in both counties specialized technical advice and assistance in solving complex production, management, and environmental challenges.Program Needs Assessment:In spring 2014, I conducted a local needs assessment, distributing surveys to 788 farmers and agribusiness professionals in Oconto and Marinette Counties. One hundred thirty-nine usable surveys were returned (17 percent response rate). Respondents were asked to rate agricultural topics based on individual educational needs (Likert scale, 1=no need to 5=high need). Highest ranked animal health topics included: calf/heifer management (2.74), dairy modernization (2.68), milk quality (2.65), and dairy facilities (2.55). Top farm management educational needs were: farm succession (3.11), financial management (2.88), and use of technology (2.76). The survey results, in addition to my educational background and experience in veterinary medicine, were used to guide and prioritize my educational programming in Oconto and Marinette Counties.Current and Emerging Issues:   Economic Hardship in the Dairy IndustryDairy farms have encountered tight margins over the past few years with low milk prices, low commodity prices, and high input costs. The outlook for dairy farmers is not predicted to change as low milk prices are forecasted throughout 2019. Many factors are driving the market price of milk in the United States: large national dairy herd, declining domestic demand, reduced global exports with imposed tariffs, and a strong dollar. Some dairy farms within the last few years have struggled financially finding themselves a statistic in the market downturn. Farms will be faced either mandated via creditors or voluntarily selling their farm business(es) to meet their outstanding debts. According to the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, Wisconsin lost 691 farms in 2018, a calendar loss of 7.9%.Farms will continue to monitoring expenses tightly, but will also face emotional and mental stress due to the inability to pay monthly bills. Farm related suicides are double that of veteran suicides. Wisconsin farm families are seeking information to assist in discussing this topic in addition to ways to communicate family budget concerns with their children, and ways to take care of themselves.Farmers will also be exploring job opportunities off the farm to meet family expense needs. These individuals will be seeking opportunities to understand the private sector hiring, creation of resumes, and proper interview techniques. Individuals may be seeking alternative options to add income from their farm businesses such as a value-added product, or utilizing their current resources in other manners.  Dairy Replacements Dairy replacements, or young animals that will ultimately become lactating animals in the herd, are the foundation for genetic progress and improvement of the herd. Raising productive and successful dairy replacements is the second highest expenditure on Wisconsin dairy farms, behind feed costs, when all factors of milk production are considered (Hagedorn et al., 2013). It is estimated to cost $2,377 to raise a single replacement animal from birth to calving (Hagedorn et al., 2013). This cost can increase significantly if young animals are taxed with diarrheal diseases, which can reduce animal growth and productivity, require treatment, and/or lead to death. The USDA National Animal Health Monitoring System estimates 23.9 percent of pre-weaned heifers are treated for diarrheal diseases (NAHMS, 2007), with diarrhea cited as the leading cause of death of dairy heifers of all age groups (NAHMS, 2011).  Animal Well-Being Animal welfare concerns exist regarding painful procedures performed on young dairy animals. In January 2019, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) released an undercover video from a Marinette County heifer raiser on their practices of dehorning animals. This video is a vivid example of the need for continued education on the proper technique for pain mitigation in dehorning. Public perception of these procedures has resulted in greater scrutiny of all animal management practices. The average population is three-generations removed from an agrarian lifestyle.  Farm Succession/Transfer According to the 2012 Census of Agriculture, the average age of farmers in Oconto and Marinette Counties was 56.4 and 58.3 years of age, respectively. Currently, there are 129 and 66 dairy farms in Oconto and Marinette Counties, respectively. Across the country, the USDA estimates 70 percent of farmland will change hands in the next 20 years (National Institute of Food and Agriculture, 2017). Therefore, successfully transferring farms to the next generation will be a necessity to ensure the vitality of the agriculture industry. Farm succession is a complex, multi-faceted process, requiring consideration of a variety of topics such as profit margins, land value, farm size, and tax rates. Farm succession is often a laborious process, requiring strategic planning and open communication between all parties.  Alternative Dairy/Livestock: GoatWisconsin is known as ""America's Dairyland"". It is a widely accepted fact, Wisconsin is the leader in the dairy cow industry; however, Wisconsin is the leader in the nation of milk goat animals according to a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agriculture Statistics Survey on January 2016. From the January 2016 USDA report, Wisconsin has 44,000 head of milking goats. Most of the milk from these animals is used for making award-winning cheese which appeals to consumers across the nation. Dairy goat herds in northeast Wisconsin continue to grow both in number and size. Goat farmers are looking for educational resources from reliable sources.The Wisconsin dairy industry is a strong economic driver for the state. However, if current economic trajectories persist, farm profit margins will continue to tighten without strong educational interjections to improve production and financial efficiencies. As an educator with University of Wisconsin-Madison Division of Extension, I play a unique and key role to continued farm success by providing relevant, research-based information to decrease farm production costs, decrease costs associated with animal health, and streamline farm inputs, as evidenced by the impacts of my on-farm research, one-on-one farm consultations, and educational programming efforts. I will continue in developing both current and future educational program efforts in animal health and well-being and farm financial health and management to meet the needs of my clientele.My outreach educational programming will focus on the following emphasis areas: 1) animal health and well-being and 2) farm financial health and management. The scope of my educational work in animal health and well-being focuses on calf and heifer management, facilities management, milk and meat quality, and alternative dairy and livestock production. My work in farm financial health and management focuses on farm succession, financial management, and farm efficiencies achieved through farm modernization."|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
55|2019 Organizational and Leadership Development|"ISSUE: Within the county there exists more than 200 non-profits. With the economic downturn in 2008 the numbers of non-profits have been increasing with the focus on improving the lives of those within the county. Many are organized to take on specific needs within their communities while others are more broad addressing social issues within a region. Yearly, I have provided services to non-profits seeking assistance in enhancing their impact addressing problems, planning for the future. Many people have noticed the lack of volunteers and ""leadership"" within the communities to provide key positions and resources in human capital. I was approached to explore and design a leadership program as in other 51 locations around the state. Additionally, I have provided educational support to dozens of groups with on-going annual support to the Marinette & Oconto Literacy Council, Inc., and Oconto Tourism Committee and some others. I will provide facilitative techniques and educational materials at monthly meetings.INVOLVEMENT 20% - 25%: In 2017, the County Economic Development Director concluded a needs assessment ($45,000 process) which identified one of four pillars is the development of future leadership. I was asked if I would assist and provide educational, research into design, and facilitative skillsets to the program. We have called our program the Leadership Oconto County (LOC). My county oversight committee has agreed to the collaborative approach and has tentatively authorized me to commit some 20% of my time towards this program. UWEX is expertly equipped at providing the facilitated steps in getting this program off of the ground through its organizational development experience. Initial items to be undertaken such as bylaws, name, board of directors 9 members, assigning a fiduciary, marketing, relationship building, funding/grants have been identified for my work.EQUITY: Most leadership positions within the government are held by males with an average age of 60. Gaining a localized program exposing residents to issues within the county could expand leadership desires in other age groups, racial and gender as well. In the past, I have attempted such a program on a small scale with funding low because this is an economically depressed county. Our plans for this program are to aim high - get organizations and businesses to commit to success of the program by having them have greater ""skin in the game"". This is a 9 month program for the students, many more for me. It will need an operational budget just over $10,000 and tuition is set at $600 per person. We used the media as well as one-on-one contacts with organizations and businesses to get participants. Leadership training will also have a component on underserved/minority populations within the county. Additionally, Marinette & Oconto Literacy Council continues to serve primarily persons of color and English as a secondary language. Providing services to this underserved audience will likely increase community cohesion. In addition - I am in the early ""exploratory"" stages of working with the Stockbridge - Munsee Indian Tribe in addressing their strategic Tribal planning steps, and I continue to work with the oconto County Board of Supervisors in defining their Leadership Values and Vision.Priority Project #1 is the Leadership Oconto CountyPriority Project #2 is Non Profit General Support"|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
56|Farm Business Management (2019)|"Fond du Lac County Agriculture & Dairy Industry: ""Agriculture works hard for Fond du Lac County every day. Family-owned farms, food processors and agriculture-related businesses generate thousands of jobs and millions of dollars of economic activity while contributing to local income and tax revenues. Fond du Lac County agriculture encompasses a mix of family farms, food processors, equipment manufacturers, retail and service providers. Dairy farms of all sizes dominate the rural landscape, ranging from fewer than 100 cows to more than 8,000.Fond du Lac County agriculture provides 7,790 jobs, or 13.6 percent, of the county's workforce of 57,293. Production jobs include farm owners, managers, and employees. Agricultural service jobs include veterinarians, crop and livestock consultants, feed, fuel and other crop input suppliers, farm machinery dealers, barn builders and agricultural lenders, to name a few. Processing jobs include those employed in food processing and other value-added industries that support food processors. Every job in agriculture generates an additional 0.73 jobs in the county. Agriculture contributes $591 million to county income Fond du Lac County agriculture accounts for $591.3 million, or 13.3 percent, of the county's total income. This includes wages, salaries, benefits and profits of farmers and workers in agriculture-related businesses. Every dollar of agricultural income generates an additional $0.79 of county income. Agriculture pumps $2.2 billion into local economy Fond du Lac County agriculture generates $2.2 billion in economic activity, about 21 percent, of the county's total economic activity. Every dollar of sales from agricultural products generates an additional $0.27 of economic activity in other parts of the county's economy. Here's how agriculture stimulates economic activity:  The direct effect of agriculture equals $1.75 billion and includes the sale of farm products and value-added products.  Purchases of agricultural and food processing inputs, services and equipment add another $316.7 million in economic activity. For example, this includes business-to-business purchases of fuel, seed, fertilizer, feed and farm machinery, as well as veterinary services, crop and livestock consultants and equipment leasing.   This business-to-business activity then generates another $157.3 million in economic activity when people who work in agriculture-related businesses spend their earnings in the local economy""Dairying remains paramount to the success of agriculture in Fond du Lac County. Fond du Lac County's 223 dairy farms (a 14 farm loss from the previous year) house 59,000 dairy cows (rank 3rd in state for cow numbers) which produce 26,300 pounds per milk per cow per year. With a total milk production of 1.55 billion pounds of milk in Fond du Lac County, Fond du Lac County is the leading county in the state for total milk production (Wisconsin Agriculture Statics Service, 2017) and falling in the top 25 US dairy-producing counties. ""Dairy is a key Fond du Lac County industry Dairy farming is the major agricultural industry in Fond du Lac County. On-farm production and milk sales account for $239.6 million. Processing milk into dairy products generates another $1.02 billion.  Eleven plants process dairy products in Fond du Lac County.   On-farm milk production accounts for 1,119 jobs, and dairy processing accounts for 2,164 jobs.  At the county level, each dairy cow generates $3,645 in on-farm sales to producers.   At the state level, each dairy cow generates over $34,000 in total sales."" Source: S. Deller, 2014 Fond du Lac County Agriculture: Value & Economic Impact2017 Program Needs Assessment: With a hire of both the Dodge County dairy & livestock agent, and the Fond du Lac/Dodge County area crops & soils agent, a joint needs assessment of both counties' farmers and agri-business community was conducted Winter 2016-2017 to identify programming priorities in the areas of dairy and agronomy. The needs assessment was distributed to extension meeting participants, as well as via email with an online survey. Based on the needs assessment (n=100), the following top educational dairy replated priorities were identified:  Nutrition ? Reproduction Animal well-being ? HousingCurrent & Emerging Issues: The dairy industry is a very dynamic industry, with new technologies and practices being developed, managing income and expenses with an ever-changing market, and an aging population.  Dairy farmers faced tight margins for the past couple years with 2019 milk prices predicted to be a better year, but still not good enough to support the farm families. The December Class III milk price was $13.78 per cwt, the second lowest in 2018. This price equates to about $3 to $4 per cwt below the cost of production for the average dairy farmer. With a large national dairy herd, declining domestic demand, reduced exports due to large global outputs of milk, and a strong dollar, prices for commodities such as milk are negatively affected. Lower milk checks means reduced income for the farm to pay expenses related to the farm business, as well as living expenses. Farmers have to watch more carefully on where they spend every dollar. With long-term low milk prices, farmers and their families are emotionally and mentally affected through stress. Many farms are exiting due to low milk prices, at a rate of over two farms per day state-wide.  Raising dairy replacement is the third largest expenditure on the farm in the production of milk, standing just behind feed costs and labor. The US dairy replacement herd continues to increase. In the 50+ years of reporting by USDA National Agriculture Statistics Service, the heifer inventory was the highest in 2016 and the second highest in 2017. With the cost of raising dairy replacement much higher than to purchase a replacement, there are opportunities to help farmer evaluate the opportunities to reduce costs in raising dairy replacements or to evaluate opportunities and risks to cull the heifer herd before a large investment is made.  Farm succession from one generation to the next can be overwhelming for families when added to the daily decisions necessary to run the farm. Farmers make decisions every day to improve their farm business and provide their family with a home and lifestyle they want for them. However, many of them have not planned for the family's and/or farm operation's long-term sustainability regarding farm succession and retirement. Based on USDA numbers, there are about 8,400 farms with operators between the ages of 45 and 64. Unfortunately, only an estimated one-third of these farms have a business succession plan in place. That means of the 8,400 farms, 5,600 farms will need some type of business succession or exit plan over the next few years (Source: J. Kirkpatrick presentation)When it comes to managing a dairy business operation, herd health, animal well-being, and sound financial management can have a substantial impact on profitability. Based on the educational priorities identified in the needs assessment as well as current and emerging issues within the overall dairy industry and community, this agent will conduct outreach for the 2018 programming year through two major program priorities: 1.) Dairy Production & Management and 2.) Farm Business Management. Please see the following Plan of Work for details."|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

58|Volunteer Development|"Adult volunteers are Wisconsin 4-H's most valuable asset in delivering the quality youth-led, adult guided programs to support youth as they acquire essential life skills. Wisconsin 4-H Youth Development has over 10,500 volunteers who are enrolled as UW-Extension 4-H volunteers working with 30,000 youth enrolled in 4-H programs. In 2018, volunteers reported on average they donated over 58 hours per year. Approximately 72% of Wisconsin 4-H volunteers are female and 28% are male. Nationally, women continue to volunteer at a higher rate than men. (Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. Department of Labor.) In Wisconsin 4-H, approximately 97% of the volunteers are white. WI 4-H Youth Development volunteers currently do not reflect the demographics of most counties.In 2018, Sheboygan County had 240 adult volunteers. The demographics of volunteers were 76 % female and 24% male with approximately 98% of the volunteers being white. Sheboygan County demographics indicates there is a potential audience of volunteers who reflect Asian and Hispanic racial and ethnic groups who are currently not volunteering in 4-H Youth Development.Volunteers play a critical role in the delivery of quality educational programs. In a survey completed January 2015, 4-H Youth Development staff identified Volunteer Development as an area in need of program support. Additionally, a WI 4-H Youth Development Survey was conducted in February 2014 of over 1500 volunteers. Adult volunteers in 4-H indicated relatively low awareness and understanding of some of the educational principles (Essential Elements and the Experiential Learning Process) that are central to the work of 4-H Youth Development. In the 2014 survey, volunteers expressed an interest in learning through not only face-to-face modalities; but also through online-learning such as webinars and podcasts. The 2017 Strategic Plan released by USDA NIFA and National 4-H Council outlines a 4-H Youth Development Vision for 2025. Nationally the following goal has been established ""Youth are surrounded with competent, prepared staff and volunteers."" This goal includes the following outcomes: ""The 4-H program is supported by a well-trained volunteer force."" ""4-H staff and volunteers engage in meaningful professional development.""In addition, there is a responsibility of volunteers to ensure access, equity and opportunity. The National 4-H Strategic goal states ""All youth engage in program and opportunities."" To that end it has been identified that ""4-H volunteers and staff are skilled, knowledgeable and prepared to work with all members of their community."" In Sheboygan County 4-H, there has been some shifts in leadership with knowledgeable volunteers retiring out. With that, some of the programs that they ran are now needing new, informed, and reliable leadership to take over. There are approximately 240 enrolled volunteers in the Sheboygan County 4-H program. Distributing duties so that not all of the work lands on a select few is important. Once volunteers are in place to be part of a committee and/or chairing the committee, it is important that they know their roles and responsibilities in relation to that committee."|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1
59|Dairy/Livestock Management and Production|Agriculture is critical to the financial viability of Eau Claire County. The Eau Claire County agriculture industry plays a large role in economic impact creating over 7,000 jobs and accounting for $1.12 billion in economic activity. There are approximately 1,300 farms in Eau Claire County with an average size of 155 acres (2012 Census of Agriculture). This agent intends to design programs that will cover the needs of a wide variety of agricultural producers. A sizable amount of time will be spent on local dairy and livestock industry issues. Programs that cover dairy, livestock, crop, soil, farm safety and community awareness educational needs will be highlighted.In 2013 a needs assessment survey of farms in Eau Claire County was conducted and completed by this agent. Heifer Management, Beef Production, Nutrient Management, Forage Quality Management, Farm Transition/Modernization and Promotion of Agricultural Awareness were the topics garnering the highest level of interest. After learning more about the area, this agent believes that many of these concerns are an accurate reflection of today's producers. Using the needs assessment survey results, exiting comments made by previous agriculture agents and personal observations, this agent determined the following areas to focus programming efforts: 1) Dairy Modernization and Management, 2) Forage Crop Management and 3) Strategies for Improved Rural/Urban Agriculture Awareness. Dairy Modernization and Management is an area of interest and concern for dairy producers to remain profitable. In a past needs assessment survey, producers said that the main factor limiting their milk quality and profitability was facilities and cow comfort. Dairy expansion and modernization projects seem to be a way for local producers to improve the profitability of their operations. Whether they are building a completely new operation, retrofitting their current facilities, or making minor additions to their current barn, extension can play a role in these changes. This agent will focus on providing support and education to producers looking to make these changes. The efforts will focus on improving profitability, animal comfort, milk quality, employee training, and improving the way of life for these operations. Forage Crop Management will revolve around the production of quality forage and grains for use on Eau Claire County farms. Eau Claire County has 204,000 acres dedicated to crop production. According to the Wisconsin Ag Statistics Service 17,700 acres are dedicated to alfalfa and other forage production and 48,200 acres are utilized for the production of corn including corn for grain and silage. Of these aforementioned acres, 34,900 acres are utilized for corn silage. Extension has the ability to use scissor clipping and corn silage burn down programming as a platform to help producers make more informed management decisions regarding the feed quality of these crops with the result being improved farm profitability.Eau Claire County dairy numbers (10,000 head) and beef (20,000 head) continue to be relatively static. The county has seen a slight decrease in the number of dairy cows from 2013 to 2017 and a slight increase in the number of beef cow/calves. The county has lost approximately 5,000 acres of agricultural land during the previous decade. Almost all of the loss is due to urban sprawl and development. As indicated, animal numbers are static and the number of farms (farmers) are decreasing. This trend indicates there is a smaller percentage of the population feeling connected to agriculture than ever before in the history of the county. With urban centers moving further into traditionally agricultural areas, issues such as neighbor relations and manure management have become increasingly important. Eau Claire County Land Conservation, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and Eau Claire County Farm Bureau have potential to be strong allies in this effort. There are opportunities for both the producers and their non-agriculture neighbors to increase understanding of each other's lifestyles through education and awareness. Chippewa, Dunn and Eau Claire counties are developing/implementing a formal specialization program involving the Agriculture and Horticulture educators in these counties. Based on the needs assessment and focus group results as well as the position description, this educator will be responsible for planning and implementing educational programs and services directly related to Animal Agriculture and Farm Management in the tri-county area.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
60|Aging Population (2019)|Oconto County is a vast rural county located in the Northeast region of the state of Wisconsin. According to the current US census, 37,430 people reside in Oconto County, which covers a total area of 1,149 square miles, of which 998 square miles is land and 151 square miles (13%) is water.1 Geologically, Oconto County offers three unique sections; the Nicolet National Forest, Oconto River Valley, and the Historic Bay Shores. The landscape is characterized by thick forests and river valleys, which means that populations are often remote in small townships and farms, 81% of Oconto County residents live in a rural area.2 Many families have lived here for generations and longtime residents pride themselves on taking care of local needs and promoting respectable communities. The town of Oconto, referred to as 'The City on the Bay' is the county seat and largest town in Oconto County with a population of 4,486.1The larger metro areas nearest Oconto County are Marinette 25 miles to the North and Green Bay 35 miles to the South. A large number of residents (44%) commute to these locations or other surrounding counties to secure work.2 The key employers in Oconto County are dairy farmers, tourism and manufacturing (Springside Cheese, ST Paper and Cruisers Yachts). Oconto County has an unemployment rate of 4.6%, which is higher than the state average (4.1%). Additionally, Oconto County residents having obtained some college education is 58%, which also is lower than the state average (68%).3,5Aging Population:Currently there are 7,145 residents over the age of 65 in Oconto County, which makes up 19.3% of the total population.6 Logically, as our aging population increases the aging population movement will continue in Oconto County. To expand further, majority of people in the United States currently retire where they spend their final years of employment.4,7 Older adults lacking strong social networks are more likely to experience declines in cognitive functioning. According to the Wisconsin Department of Administration Demographic Service the projected population of individuals aged 65 years or older in Oconto County will increase to 25% by 2025.5,6 Over 92% of older adults (65 years and older) in Oconto County live out in the community.12 Therefore, family caregivers often play an important role in helping these individuals live independently. The projected growth of the older population in the U.S. will present challenges to policy makers and government programs, such as Medicare and Social Security.8.9 In turn, it will also affect families, businesses, and health care providers. Older adults lacking strong social networks are more likely to experience declines in cognitive functioning.13 More so, with an increasing older adult population in Oconto County, maintaining long-term health and overall well-being will be primary needs for this population.12 Health Influences: Approximately two-thirds of all deaths in Wisconsin are attributed to chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes.12 According to the County Health Rankings data (2018), Oconto County cancer incidence rate (481 per 100,000) is above the Wisconsin state rate (469 per 100,000).2 Physical inactivity and poor diet have been shown to be correlated with cancer, diabetes, heart disease and stroke.11 In Oconto County, current health behavior data specifies that 25% of adults are not physically active and only 20% of adults report eating the recommended quantities of fruits and vegetables each day.1 Frailty is the leading cause for falls among the older adult population.13Areas of evidence have shown over the years that health outcomes are not just driven by health care or by individual behaviors but also by social, economic, and environmental conditions that include the living conditions of individuals, families and communities.11 Leading health professionals and researchers agree that to advance health and health parity, we must address the social determinants of health, via the conditions where we live, learn, work, play and grow.Data suggest that mental health awareness, excessive alcohol use, and lack of physical activity are education areas needed by Oconto County residents. Oconto County residents ages 65 or older (19.3%).2Oconto County adults have a high percent of excessive alcohol drinking (24%); state average (26%).2Oconto County deaths associated with alcohol-impaired driving (44%), significantly higher than the state average (36%).2Oconto County resident adult smoking average (16%) and adult obesity is (31%).2 Oconto County residents have much less access to exercise opportunities (64%), compared to the state average (86%).21. http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/55/55083.html2 http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/wisconsin/2015/rankings/oconto/county/outcomes/overall/additional3.

61|Master Gardener Training Program|Gardening has continued to be one of the favorite hobbies of Americans. According to the National Gardening Association in 2014, 35% of all households in America, or 42 million households, are growing food at home or in a community garden, up 17% in five years. UW-Extension and Master Gardener Volunteers provide research based programs and resources needed to support gardening as an enjoyable, satisfying, and environmentally responsible activity. However, still many working adults, parents and senior citizens in the county lack the knowledge and confidence to be successful gardeners.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
62|After School Programming|National studies, like afterschoolalliance.org, indicate that 1 in 5 kids are alone and unsupervised from 3 to 6 p.m. These are the hours when juvenile crime and victimization peak and many parents are still at work.After school programs in general tend to provide great outcomes in improved attitudes and less aggressive behavior, reduced engagement of risky behaviors, reduction of drug use, as well as an increase in physical activity and better diet choices.In La Crosse County, the Great Rivers United Way Compass 2018 reported that due to moderate abuse rates (3.3%) and an increase of out-of-home placements over the last 5 years (8% more), the well-being of our children is suffering. Juvenile arrest rates in La Crosse County are the highest in the region and about twice as high as the state average. Specific to La Crosse County and 4-H, an after school program would focus on providing children a safe, positive environment to explore mastery of certain interests thereby increasing their overall self-confidence, and by offering belonging in a 4-H club thereby increasing their ability to work as a team and build their self-esteem. These qualities are imperative to the well-being of our children.|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1
63|Protecting Water Quality in Washburn County|Washburn County has over 900 lakes and numerous streams, including 33 trout streams. It also has two Wild and Scenic rivers, the Namekagon and the Totagatic. When lakes or rivers exceed state standards for water quality they are listed on the 303(d) list as an impaired waterbody. Only seven lakes and one stream in Washburn County are impaired due to high levels of phosphorus. However, land values, tourism economy, and the public health rely on maintaining high water quality. A study in Vilas and Oneida Counties found better water clarity was correlated with higher home values (Kemp et al. 2017). Natural resources are the top draws for tourism in Washburn County as well. Washburn County residents that do not own waterfront also benefit from good water quality through drinking water, quality hunting and fishing opportunities, and recreation opportunities. Water quality was also mentioned frequently in stakeholder conversations in 2018. Washburn County is highly susceptible to groundwater contamination due to the dominance of sandy soils. In Wisconsin 70% of residents and 95% of communities rely on groundwater for their drinking water. Excess nutrients such as nitrates can contaminate the groundwater and cause health problems when consumed. Thus it is important to protect Washburn County's waters from excess nutrients.The sources of excess nutrients are often varied, including waterfront properties and sources further from a waterbody, or upland sources (EPA 2017). Upland sources can be municipal, industrial, or agricultural. Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WI DNR) regulates most of the municipal and industrial point sources as well as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs). Other farms are not regulated in the same way. In some cases, efforts to control nutrient loss are voluntary. Given the narrow profit margins for agriculture, voluntary efforts are often not considered due to the cost and difficulty of adopting alternative methods. A few organizations currently work with farmers to implement some water quality protection, including the Natural Resources Conservation Service branch of the US Department of Agriculture, the Washburn County Land and Water Department, and WI DNR. Current Extension Washburn County Agriculture efforts have not focused on the water quality-farm practice connection. With the breadth of Extension resources and connection to experts, Extension is positioned to help connect the farm and waterfront people for a common goal of protecting water quality. Many organizations are currently working with lakeshore owners to improve shorelines to better protect water quality through a variety of practices. These groups include The Washburn County Land and Water Department, Wisconsin DNR, Washburn County Lakes and Rivers Association, and individual lake associations. These groups have been focused on raising awareness and providing funds for implementation. One key minority group that is often not in the conversation for water quality in Washburn County is the Native American population. Being in the Ceded Territory means that the local tribes (St. Croix band of Ojibwe and Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Ojibwe) have retained their rights to hunt, fish, and gather on the lands and waters of Washburn county. They have a vested interest in maintaining their connection to the natural resources of Washburn county. Kemp, T., S.Zhou, S. Wu. 2017.

64|Animal Agriculture Programming (2019)|"Situation StatementWashington County Agriculture & Dairy Industry: ""Agriculture works hard for Washington County every day. Family-owned farms, food processors and agriculture-related businesses generate thousands of jobs and millions of dollars of economic activity while contributing to local income and tax revenues. Washington County agriculture is diverse, which adds to its strength. Dairy leads the way, but grain, greenhouse and nursery, livestock, vegetable and farm-direct markets are also very important. Washington County's diverse agricultural atmosphere is a vital part of the area's culture, communities and economy. Residents find that this rural urban mix adds value to their quality of life. Employers find that it helps recruit high quality employees.Washington County agriculture provides 4,353 jobs, or about 7 percent, of the county's workforce of 66,760. Production jobs include farm owners and managers and farm employees. Agricultural service jobs include veterinarians, crop and livestock consultants, feed, fuel and other crop input suppliers, farm machinery dealers, barn builders and agricultural lenders, to name a few. Processing jobs include those employed in food processing and other value-added industries that support food processors. Every job in agriculture generates an additional 1.18 jobs in the county.Agriculture contributes about $435 million to county income Washington County agriculture accounts for $434.9 million, or 7 percent, of the county's total income. This includes wages, salaries, benefits and profits of farmers and workers in agriculture-related businesses. Every dollar of agricultural income generates an additional $0.85 of county income.Washington County agriculture generates $1.43 billion in economic activity, about 25 percent, of the county's total economic activity. Every dollar of sales from agricultural products generates an additional $0.41 of economic activity in other parts of the county's economy. Here's how agriculture stimulates economic activity:  The direct effect of agriculture equals $1.2 billion and includes the sale of farm products and value-added products.   Purchases of agricultural and food processing inputs, services and equipment add another $320.5 million in economic activity. For example, this includes business-to-business purchases of fuel, seed, fertilizer, feed and farm machinery, as well as veterinary services, crop and livestock consultants and equipment leasing.  This business-to-business activity then generates another $92.2 million in economic activity when people who work in agriculture-related businesses spend their earnings in the local economy.Economic activity associated with Washington County farms and agriculture related businesses generates $22.8 million in local and state taxes. This figure does not include all property taxes paid to support local schools. If it did, the number would increase dramatically.Dairy is a key Washington County industry. Dairy farming is the major agricultural industry in Washington County. On-farm production and milk sales account for $82.2 million. Processing milk into dairy products generates another $431.7 million.  Seven plants process dairy products in Washington County.  On-farm milk production accounts for 437 jobs, and dairy processing accounts for 1,012 jobs.  At the county level, each dairy cow generates $4,377 in on-farm sales to producers.  At the state level, each dairy cow generates about $34,000 in total sales.Source: S.

Deller, 2014 Washington County Agriculture: Value & Economic ImpactCurrent & Emerging Issues: The agriculture industry is a very dynamic industry, with new technologies and practices being developed, managing income and expenses with an ever-changing markets, and an aging population.  Dairy farmers faced tight margins for the past couple years with 2019 milk prices predicted to raise slightly, but farm income is not expected to improve for the year. With a large national dairy herd, declining domestic demand, reduced exports due to large global outputs of milk, and a strong dollar, prices for commodities such as milk are negatively affected. Prices for other commodity crops such as corn and soybeans are also expected to remain low which, and farm income for grain producers is projected to go negative for 2019. Lower milk checks and grain prices mean reduced income for the farm to pay expenses related to the farm business, as well as living expenses. Farmers have to watch where they spend every dollar more carefully. With long-term low commodity prices, farmers and their families are emotionally and mentally affected through stress, and more farmers are considering exiting the industry or enterprise. When it comes to managing a farm business operation, production, herd health, animal well-being, and sound financial management can have a substantial impact on profitability. Based on the educational priorities identified in the needs assessment as well as current and emerging issues within the overall agriculture industry and community, this educator will conduct outreach for the 2019 programming year through two major program priorities: 1.) Farm Business Management and 2.) Animal Agriculture. Please see the following Plan of Work for details."|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
65|Health and Well Being Programming (2019)|"The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. A state of well-being suggests that every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to contribute to her or his community. There are four primary factors in communities that influence health either directly or indirectly. The factors form the social and political determinants of health, which include economic environment; social environment; physical environment and services. Determinants of Food and Nutrition Security An international study conducted by FoodSecure, an interdisciplinary research project to explore the future of food and nutrition security, created a framework that analyzed the determinants of food and nutrition security. Highlights from that study include the following: There are three major dimensions of the food and nutrition status--food availability, food access and food utilization. Unfortunately, not much research has examined the causal effect of financial literacy and household financial practices on food security. Financial literacy may be pivotal to understanding the prevalence food security that is restricted by household resources. As reported in Gundersen et al. (2011) and Coleman-Jensen et al (2014), higher levels of food insecurity are associated with households: Having incomes at or below the federal poverty line Headed by single parents, African-American and Hispanic individuals, renters, and less educated individuals. Primary earner's employment is defined by holding multiple jobs, working varied hours, or working a part-time job What is going on in People's Lives?The relationship between socioeconomic determinants of health (the conditions that contribute to health, such as income and education) and health outcomes is one of the most robust and well documented findings in social science (Marmot & Wilkinson, 2006). The social determinants of health demonstrate that not all communities have equal opportunity for health and wellness. The majority of the diversity for the State of Wisconsin is concentrated in the Southeastern region that includes Milwaukee proper. Across our lifecycles, there are multiple times and ways in which we are primed to look around us   for advice, for products, for a hand   before we make a decision that affects us financially. Some of the structural determinants include systems of healthcare, education, and economics. Social networks. The individual has direct contact and can easily be influenced by i.e. family and peers. Living and Working Conditions. Living and working conditions are indicators of health. The major indicators of health include education, employment status, educational attainment, rental occupancy, car ownership; home ownership, median income and female headed-households. Macro-level Conditions and Policies. Macro-level conditions and policies are broad social, economic, cultural, health and environmental conditions and policies at global, national, state and local levels. UW-Extension has a unique role in responding to the needs at the community and state level. We are positioned in countries with direct links to community partners, stakeholders and residents. We have links to University data and research. UW-Extension can better develop and support community-academic research partnerships, translate health interventions for dissemination for community leaders, and directly teach and create policy to better impact community health.According to the United Way ALICE Report for Milwaukee County Demographics: Milwaukee has a population: 956,406 Number of Households: 382,382 Median Household Income: $42,765 (state average: $52,622) Unemployment Rate: 8.5% (state average: 5.3%) Gini Coefficient (zero = equality; one = inequality): 0.48 (state average: 0.44) The Economic Viability Dashboard evaluates community conditions for ALICE in three core areas. Each is an index with a scale of 1 (worst) to 100 (best) Housing Affordability (18 = poor) Job Opportunities (42 = poor) Community Resources (53 = fair) What does it cost to afford the necessities? This bare-minimum budget does not allow for any savings, leaving a household vulnerable to unexpected expenses. Affording only a very modest living in each community, this budget is still significantly more than the Federal Poverty Level of $11,670 for a single adult and $23,850 for a family of four. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, there are several factors that determine well-being: Social and economic environment What surrounds you, your family and community. Personality and Attitudes How you tend to feel, think and act. Behavior What you actually do. Personal financial well-being How satisfied you are with your financial situation. Decision context How a particular decision is presented. Knowledge and Skill What you know, what you know how to do. Available opportunities What options are open to you? Financial Capability LifecycleIt is imperative to have present and future financial goals as it relates to security and freedom of choice. Security is expressed in the present day through the ability to have control over day-to-day and month-to-month finances. It is having the freedom to make choices to enjoy life. Security is expressed in the future by the capacity to absorb financial shock and with the ability to make financial goals that are attainable. These decisions are critical not only for how they affect today's financial capability, but their downstream impacts as well -- how they affect a person's long-term financial well-being. To paint a picture of how financial capability develops, consider three types of lifecycle events:  Universal experiences: things that happen to everyone, like early childhood and middle school Expected or recurring experiences: things that happen for most of us, but at different points in life, like having kids, getting a post-secondary education, paying taxes and finding a place to live The unexpected: things that may or may not happen, but if they do there is a financial impact, like losing a job, getting sick or having to care for aging parentsA Framework for Improving Health Outcome for Children and AdultsRacism and other forms of discrimination; living in poverty; low educational attainment; poor access to public transit; little to no quality, affordable childcare; an incarcerated family member; or the inability to obtain affordable housing in a safe neighborhood are all examples of social conditions that increase stress levels in adults and children. However, because these are not one-time events, but actual living conditions, they lead to chronic stress (also referred to as ""toxic stress"") (http://astho.org/Health-Equity/Documents/Foundational-Practices-for-Health-Equity/).The predominant understanding of health inequities continues to focus on receipt of health care services and the behavioral choices of individuals. This understanding prevails despite a growing body of research and clear evidence of the influences of systems and structures on population health, all of which describe current and historical landscapes of policies, systems, and environments that create structural inequities and limit opportunities for health. The Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) of the World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO CSDH) Framework incorporates the social determinants of health and highlights many systemic influences on health and well-being. This framework recognizes that economic, social (including racial and ethnic discrimination), and political conditions are not naturally occurring, but are instead the result of public policy and other community or collective actions. These conditions are rooted in long-term structures and traditions that will require new partnerships and new strategies to change them. The WHO CSDH Framework (see Figure 1) synthesizes relevant evidence and theory in order to examine how health inequities arise and to support the development of effective actions to modify the differential distribution of health. The WHO CSDH Framework is best understood by focusing on the broad domains and how these domains connect to each other to influence health. Moving right to left, the framework describes how health outcomes are impacted by intermediary determinants, structural determinants, and cross-cutting determinants.Varieties of factors contribute to the health of Wisconsin residents. According to the County Health Rankings Model from the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, four major health factors shape health. Those factors and relative percent weight on shaping health are health behaviors, 30%; clinical care, 20%; social and economic factors, 40%; and physical environment, 10% (http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/our-approach). Individuals and families need knowledge and skills to make healthy decisions in all of these health factors. They also need community supports and environments, as well as systems and policies to assure that the healthy choice is the easiest choice for them and their families.According to the 2018 Wisconsin County Health Rankings, Milwaukee County ranks 71 out of the 72 Wisconsin counties in the area of health outcomes. Milwaukee County ranks 71 out of 72 counties when looking at all the factors related to health behaviors. (http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/wisconsin/...). Health outcomes include factors such as the length and quality of life. Health behaviors include factors such as smoking, obesity, access to food, physical activity and alcohol use.Equity is the key to increasing economic and social opportunity. With a racial equity lens we can identify, understand, make visible, support, and lift up the work of people and communities who understand the fallacy of whiteness as supremacy and lifting up those who lead from an inclusive or community self-determining framework. By initially focusing on racial equity, we can address Milwaukee's most persistent disparities while developing a permanent shift towards fairer practice and institutions that benefit all. The Cooperative Extension National Framework for Health and Wellness provides a clear plan for increasing the number of healthy and safe environments, and healthy choices will increase the number of healthy people. The framework supports a focus on integrating systems, improving health and health insurance literacy, improving chronic disease prevention and management, teaching positive youth development and providing health policy issues education to shape the factors that influence population health. Building peoples' financial capabilities can contribute to financial empowerment, which can result in the well-being of individuals, families and communities. Financial vulnerable families deserve our respect. To practice cultural humility is to maintain a willingness to suspend what you know, or what you think you know, about a person based on generalizations about their culture. Community Health literature suggests cultural humility has three dimensions: lifelong learning & critical self-reflection, recognizing and challenging power imbalances for respectful partnerships and institutional accountability. Individuals in special circumstances often face unique financial challenges that make it difficult for them to use effectively the mainstream personal financial options available to the public. These individuals often face barriers such as limited financial resources, language, low-literacy levels, or a lack of access to technology. It is imperative to utilize the principles of cultural humility when engaging in this work."|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
66|Summer Daycare SPIN 4-H Club|Daycare Summer Club: Current Vernon County demographics coincide with large enrollments of K-3 youth in the county's 4-H program. According to US Census data, the median age in Vernon County is approximately 42 years old, which implies that more families are moving into the area with or having young children. While numbers within clubs are growing, (there are 66 Cloverbuds enrolled currently) there are many younger youth, grades K-6, which have not been reached. As these new families increase, day cares are also encountering a strain in both staffing and programming. Through high quality programming and partnership with a large day care, 4-H staff and volunteers can continue to target K-6 youth through a chartered summer 4-H club.|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1
67|Agriculture Economic Development (2019)|Community members with an interest in agriculture economic development participated in a focus group conducted by this educator in 2011. Attendees of this focus group indicated future educational programming should include: developing niche and alternative markets, including value added processing, forms of direct marketing, and agricultural tourism/entertainment; entrepreneurship & business planning; develop networks and collaborations to promote agriculture economic development. As the non-farm population continues to increase throughout Dunn County, education of modern agricultural practices and assisting those consumers in identifying where people's feed comes from will be increasingly important.Women producing specialty and value-added products are a rapidly growing segment of the agriculture industry across the country and particularly in Western Wisconsin. The background of women principal operators is significantly different from the general population with a higher percentage of beginning farmers and small acreage farms.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
68|Community Garden Program (2018)|Brown County's 2016 Leading Indicators for Excellence (LIFE) Study identified high rates of obesity, hunger disparities by income, and racial/ethnic inequality and exclusion as top opportunities for county improvement.[1] Community gardens offer the unique opportunity to impact all of these areas, and since 1996, the Brown County UW-Extension Community Gardens Program has provided gardening space to the community that helps to address and alleviate these concerns. Additionally, since its inception, the Community Gardens Program has especially worked to reach low-income and immigrant populations due to the particular health, food security, and community building concerns this population often faces. Brown County statistics indicate a need for both physical and mental health intervention. The County Health Rankings reports a 30% obesity rate in Brown County, with a negative projected trend for the future.[2] The Rankings also lists a physical inactivity rate of 19% and a shortage of mental health care providers in Brown County. Statistics are especially concerning for low-income and ethnic and racial minority populations, whose physical and mental health are frequently below those of higher income and white, non-Hispanic populations. The National Health Interview Survey, for example, reported some diet and exercise-related health problem rates for low-income families as more than twice the population's average.[3] Food security, as well as access to healthy food, is also of concern. Feeding America reports a 10.3% food insecurity rate in Brown County[4] and the rate of school-age children eligible for free or reduced lunch in Brown County nearly doubled between 2000 and 2012.[5] Additionally, the County Health Rankings rates each county's food environment, based on food insecurity and healthy food access, and Brown County received a score of 8.4 out of 10, lower than the statewide average of 8.8. Access to healthy food correlates closely to income and food security: A 2014 study of Brown County food pantry users found that 73% of respondents reduced their fruit and vegetable intake because of these items' cost, an increase from 69% in 2009. 3 Food security also varies by race and ethnicity: The USDA reports some minority families often have less food security than the national average. [6]In 2017, 211 families, over 70% of whom self-identified as being of low or moderate income, rented one or more community garden plots at one of the Brown County UW-Extension Community Gardens Program's 10 garden sites. Of responding participants, around 36% self-identified as Asian, and 9% as Hispanic. Each fall, community gardeners are surveyed about the program's impact and any benefits provided. Participants routinely report positive program impacts, including increased fruit and vegetable consumption (88% of respondents [36% response rate] in 2017), more physical activity (92% in 2017), being more easily able to provide enough food for their families (77% in 2017), and meeting more people from cultures and backgrounds different from their own (68% in 2017). In addition, 2017 gardeners raised an estimated nearly $300,000 worth of produce, applying a USDA formula.[7] These outcomes indicate community gardens' effectiveness in reaching its community improvement goals by improving health, food security, community, and inclusiveness. All of these impacts create a healthier, more connected, and more functional society.Lastly, participating gardeners are asked annually to submit their ideal garden size, and each year gardeners request multiple acres of space beyond what the program currently provides. Furthermore, 39% of surveyed Brown County food pantry users reported in 2014 that having access to a gardening space would help them improve food access.[8] This indicates both the value of the current programming and the additional opportunities and expansion needed to fully meet community needs.

69|Social/Emotional well-being|Kenosha County sits in the southeastern corner of Wisconsin; it is a fairly central location in between Milwaukee, WI and Chicago, IL and considered to be part of the Chicago metropolitan, Chicagoland, area. In the recent and coming years, Kenosha County has seen and will continue to see marked growth of population. The population of Kenosha County was estimated to be 168,521 in 2017[1] and is currently projected to be 200,620 by 2030.[2] It is important to address current health issues within the existing population, as well as think about the coming influx of residents. In 2018, Kenosha County ranked 59 of 72 Wisconsin counties for Health Outcomes (length and quality of life) and 66 of 72 for Health Factors (health behaviors, clinical care, social & economic factors, and physical environment). [3] As the county's population continues to expand, addressing facets to enhance the overall health of our residents is imperative. Kenosha County has fairly defined lines and areas that can be described as 'urban,' 'suburban,' and 'rural.' Understanding these portions of the county exist are important in ensuring all sectors of the population are reached, as lifestyles within these areas have a lot of variance.Well-being is a driving force of a person's ability to cope with and prosper in life. There are many elements which contribute to the overall well-being of an individual, family, and community. Behavioral health of the community can set the stage for residents' success and safety within the area. Kenosha County is in the midst of reframing their Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP), 'Healthy People Kenosha County' for the coming years of 2020-2025. In late 2018, one of the three identified areas of concern was determined to be mental health. This topic has emerged to be an understood important facet of a strong community. Behavioral health has recently been identified as a program area for the Health & Well-Being Institute, with underscores of mental health (social/emotional well-being) and substance use prevention.Attaining financial well-being is a personal state and is not only defined by measurements. It is having financial security and freedom of choice. Cost of living in Kenosha as it is now and in the future has been a concern for residents living close to or under poverty thresholds. Kenosha County's median prices for homes and rental units continues to climb, as the county population and demand for housing climbs. Standards say only 30% of income should go toward collective housing costs; however, area median rent is $884 and rising. In 2016, Kenosha County had an eviction rate of 3.47%, which was the second highest county rate in the state, only behind neighboring Racine County. [4] Rent burden and general financial security holds people back from being able to plan for emergencies, save money, pay household bills, repair credit, among other things. Food is a necessity of life for everyone. It is the fuel that contributes to the ability to learn, work, and play. Food insecurity is the lack of assured access to enough food for a healthy and active life and is tied to a person's financial security in many ways. According to the UW-Madison Applied Population Lab, Wisconsin Food Security Project, Kenosha County holds an 11.2% rate of food insecurity of its residents, with an 18.6% rate for children specifically.[5] These rates are slightly higher than state rates of 11% and 17% respectively. UW-Extension has a history in working to strengthen food security across the state. The foundation for food security includes: communities that support economic well-being, strong federal food and nutrition programs, adequate access to and availability of safe, healthy, and affordable food, and a strong and accessible emergency/charitable food safety net. Meeting with potential partners and stakeholders in the community has been imperative, as Kenosha County's Extension office did not previously have an equivalent position (formerly Family Living) for a number of years and many did not have a frame of reference for possible programming. Through gathering input from community stakeholders, participating in the Area 22 Developmental Situational Analysis, and input from Kenosha County's Extension Education Committee, initial programming areas have been identified to be social/emotional well-being, financial security, and food security.

70|Developing Leadership (2019)|"Adult volunteers are Wisconsin 4-H's most valuable asset in delivering the quality youth-led, adult guided programs to support youth as they acquire essential life skills. Wisconsin 4-H Youth Development has over 9,650 volunteers who are enrolled as UW-Extension 4-H volunteers working with 30,000 youth enrolled in 4-H programs. In 2018, volunteers reported on average they donated over 58 hours per year. Approximately 72% of Wisconsin 4-H volunteers are female and 28% are male. Nationally, women continue to volunteer at a higher rate than men. (Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. Department of Labor.) In Wisconsin 4-H, approximately 97% of the volunteers are white. WI 4-H Youth Development volunteers currently do not reflect the demographics of most counties.In 2018, Burnett County had 35 adult volunteers. The demographics of volunteers mirrors the state's demographics closely with 77% female and 23% male and approximately 97% of the volunteers being white. In 2018, 4-H welcomed our fifth club to Burnett County. This has helped increase the number of volunteers and members. Volunteers play a critical role in the delivery of quality educational programs. In a survey completed January 2015, 4-H Youth Development staff identified Volunteer Development as an area in need of program support. Additionally, a WI 4-H Youth Development Survey was conducted in February 2014 of over 1500 volunteers. Adult volunteers in 4-H indicated relatively low awareness and understanding of some of the educational principles (Essential Elements and the Experiential Learning Process) that are central to the work of 4-H Youth Development. In the 2014 survey, volunteers expressed an interest in learning through not only face-to-face modalities; but also through online-learning such as webinars and podcasts. Burnett County volunteers have told Beth Rank, on multiple occasions, that they have enjoyed participating in annual leader trainings that could be accessed from the comfort of their own homes. In addition to the needs for positive youth development education, many Burnett County 4-H families routinely forget to add the hyphen between the 4 and H in 4-H. According to USDA NIFA, Division of Youth & 4-H document 4-H Name and Emblem User Guide for non-Extension Entities (Revised February 2014), 4-H must always be displayed as numeral ""4"" separated from a capital ""H"" with a hyphen (not a dash, slash, or space). It is a violation of the name and emblem to use anything other than a hyphen. Beth Rank has tried to gently remind volunteers when she sees it written or typed. The problem seems to be getting worse instead of better. Youth leadership development programs provide skill development and the opportunity to apply learned leadership skills. University of Illinois Extension (Diaz et al, 2015) has identified six action areas where youth leaders develop competency in 4-H Youth Development: 1) planning, 2) promoting, 3) teaching, 4) mentoring, 5) advocating, and 6) advising. Program examples and outcomes in each of these six areas were highlighted in a 2016 Wisconsin 4-H impact report: https://fyi.uwex.edu/4h/files/2014/06/2016-Wisconsin-4-H-Foundational-Topics-Report.pdf.Thirty-one percent of currently enrolled leaders in Burnett County 4-H are youth. These youth self-select to be listed as a youth leader. Burnett County 4-H members who are in 6th grade or higher are highly encouraged, but not required, to enroll in the Youth Leadership project. Currently there are twenty-two youth enrolled in the Youth Leadership project in Burnett County, of the 22, two members are in 5th grade and can't wait to join the 4-H Junior Leaders group next year. The Jr Leaders group is for youth to learn together as older members. Jr. Leaders aim to expand their leadership role in their club, community, county, and beyond. Beth Rank has been advising this group and providing educational programming since March 2014. Every year new youth have chosen to attend the monthly meetings. The group has grown from 3 youth attending meetings in 2014 to 16 youth attending in 2018. Average attendance during 2017-2018 4-H year was 9 youth. Youth who attend Jr Leaders meetings have shared with Beth a desire to learn new leadership skills and expressed openness to learning a variety of different leadership skills. In 2014, a county-wide Cloverbud Leadership Team was created with four adult 4-H volunteers as leaders. They hosted monthly meetings in Siren. Cloverbuds is a project open only to youth in grades 5K-2nd grade. Over the years older youth who are interested in careers in education or other youth programming have asked to join the Cloverbud Leadership Team. During the 2016-2017 4-H year, almost all of the monthly Cloverbud meetings, now offered in two locations, were taught by youth leaders. Because of the amount of youth leader interest in this project area, there is a need to offer education to youth leaders. Beth Rank has identified a need to continue to expand youth leader knowledge of the Essential Elements of Positive Youth Development (belonging, independence, generosity, and mastery) in the Cloverbud project.Beyond the 4-H program, there may be a need for volunteer development of other non-profit organizations. To my knowledge statistics do not exist of how many non-profit organizations are active in Burnett County. And, regardless of how many there are, do any have unmet needs with regards to program development, bylaw creation, leadership education, etc. that UW-Extension could assist them with? This could be a gap in programming to be filled in future years."|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1
71|Soil and Forage |Accurate assessment of nutrient management for crop production and forage quality for animal production has a huge impact on the ability of farms to optimize the economic and environmental impacts of management practices. Soil testing and science based fertilizer recommendations enable the farmers to apply nutrients to maximize crop production while avoiding overapplications of nutrients that threaten the environment. Accurate and appropriately applied forage analysis can help ensure good ration formulation, support the adoption of new crops. Laboratory analysis can be a key part of the optimization our agricultural system.|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
72|Local Government |According to a recent Wisconsin Women's Council report, of the 13,000 elected offices in Wisconsin, women held only 23% of the seats overall and 14% of leadership positions. Only about 23% of city council and 22% of village board members statewide are women.* Systematically encouraging more women to run for office may be part of the solution to identifying the next generation of leaders, electing more diverse governing bodies, and giving voice to citizens otherwise lacking advocates.Wisconsin election laws require election workers complete at least two hours of training every year. While it is the duty of the municipal clerk to ensure election inspectors meet training requirements, there is no official curriculum provided. This leaves County Clerks responsible for developing their own training materials.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
73|Small Animal Committee (2019)|Small Animal Committee: Since beginning my position as a 4-H Coordinator for Vernon County in June 2018, I have become aware of several areas within the program that need attention. While 4-H offers projects in a variety of different subject areas, Vernon County is struggling to provide leadership, education, and assistance within county-wide projects. Currently, only the dairy, shooting sports, dog, and horse projects are active. Given the amount of projects that members can sign up for, this is an area that needs attention through the implementation of high quality programming. After reviewing project membership, 243 youth were signed up in the 2017-18 year for the rabbit, poultry, sheep, and goat projects. There was a high breakdown of youth enrolling in either all 4 or a combination of the projects thus providing the possibility to form a small animal committee.|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1
74|Addressing Farm Viability (2019)|Farm gate prices have been in a slump for 5 years in a row. The slump is affecting farms of all types and sizes. Many farms are questioning the viability of their farming business. Many farms are trying to figure out if they are viable enough to continue into the next generation or stay in business at all. As of 9/30/18 there had been 458 chapter 12 bankruptcy filings for the fiscal year in Wisconsin alone. Farmer's who are able to stay in farming are wondering where to go next. These farms are feeling the stress of finances while trying to make clear decisions about what to do. Many farms have tried to expand by adding more acreage. This has lead to an increase in cash rent prices and greater animosity towards other farmers who are now viewed as competition for the same land. There is a very real fear that the rapid expansion of some farms will accelerate the demise of neighboring farms. The fear and stress often manifests itself as anger and depression.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
75|Volunteer Development|"Adult volunteers are Wisconsin 4-H's most valuable asset in delivering the quality youth-led, adult guided programs to support youth as they acquire essential life skills. Wisconsin 4-H Youth Development has over 10,500 volunteers who are enrolled as UW-Extension 4-H volunteers working with 30,000 youth enrolled in 4-H programs. In 2017, volunteers reported on average they donated over 54 hours per year. Approximately 70% of Wisconsin 4-H volunteers are female and 30% are male. Nationally, women continue to volunteer at a higher rate than men. (Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. Department of Labor.) In Wisconsin 4-H, approximately 97% of the volunteers are white. WI 4-H Youth Development volunteers currently do not reflect the demographics of most counties.In 2018, Marathon County had 268 adult volunteers. The demographics of volunteers were 76% female and 24% male with approximately 99% of the volunteers being white. Marathon County demographics indicates there is a potential audience of volunteers who reflect Asian, Hispanic, Black and other racial and ethnic groups who are currently not volunteering in 4-H Youth Development.Volunteers play a critical role in the delivery of quality educational programs. In a survey completed January 2015, 4-H Youth Development staff identified Volunteer Development as an area in need of program support.

The 2017 Strategic Plan released by USDA NIFA and National 4-H Council outlines a 4-H Youth Development Vision for 2025. Nationally the following goal has been established ""Youth are surrounded with competent, prepared staff and volunteers."" This goal includes the following outcomes: ""The 4-H program is supported by a well-trained volunteer force."" ""4-H staff and volunteers engage in meaningful professional development.""In addition, there is a responsibility of volunteers to ensure access, equity and opportunity. The National 4-H Strategic goal states ""All youth engage in program and opportunities."" To that end it has been identified that ""4-H volunteers and staff are skilled, knowledgeable and prepared to work with all members of their community."" Few Marathon County volunteers know their roles or scope of opportunities to them as volunteers. Also, the 2013-2017 5-Year Estimate of Marathon County Population by Race and Ethnicity projects 89.1% White alone, 5.7% Asian and 2.7% Hispanic or Latino demographics, provides a target of having our volunteer group reflect the demographics."|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1

The experience level of the incoming general and co-general leaders varies considerably. Current Volunteer in Preparation (VIP) training does not include how to be an effective leader.In the last five years, the Wood County 4-H program has undergone considerable staffing changes. Three (3) FTE positions dedicated to 4-H Youth Development (one educator, one program advisor, and one support staff) have been reduced to about 1.85 (1.0 program coordinator, 0.5 educator, and 0.35 support staff.) Staff are not able to fulfill all of the tasks that they have in the past.

77|Manure/Nutrient Management and Safety |Agriculture in Chippewa County is vital to the overall county economy. In 2014, it was estimated Chippewa County agriculture contributes $618 million in economic activity and $205 million in total income. Agriculture also provides jobs for 3,387 Chippewa County residents. Over 1700 farms are located in Chippewa County according to the USDA 2012 Census of Agriculture. These farms average 219 acres in size. Horticulture contributes another $1 million in economic activity in the county with fruit crop and other specialty crops leading the way. Major crops grown in Chippewa County include corn (90,000 acres), soybean (50,000 acres, and alfalfa (25,000 acres). With a variety of agriculture and horticulture in Chippewa County, it is my intent to deliver programs in the areas of agronomy, soil and manure management, and horticulture.A Chippewa County Agriculture Needs Assessment Survey in 2015 revealed nutrient management as a top priority. Farmers indicated a need for improved nutrient management and utilization of on-farm nutrient sources in order to reduce input costs and increase profitability. Farmers will continue to seek out information and methods to better manage crop input costs as commodity prices in 2018 are forecasted to remain low and below a profitable range for many farms. Custom manure applicators and dairy and livestock producers remain interested in gaining information about new manure handling technology and safety. Demand for safety training and information has increased in response to recent farm accidents. Safety related to manure gases and manure handling equipment will be addressed through workshops and field meetings.Cover crops are being planted on several farms in Chippewa County as a result of an increased awareness of soil health and erosion benefits. NRCS has provided cost-sharing to farmers to incentivize and implement the practice of using cover crops. With limited cover crop data on Chippewa County soils and climate, the need for applied research to determine best management practices for cover crops and their benefits and challenges is needed. Commodity prices are projected to remain low in 2018 and some farmers are looking to alternative crops to provide additional income. Malting barley, hops, and industrial hemp have all peaked interest as alternative crops. UW-Extension is positioned to help farmers make decisions regarding these crops. Industrial hemp will only be addressed by this agent if approval to participate in the pilot research project from DATCP is secured.Chippewa County is home to 257 dairy farms, 26,000 milking cows, over 350 beef farms, and 4,500 head of beef cattle. The dairy industry remains the number one agricultural industry in Chippewa County and forage production is vitally important to milk production. Dairy and forage producers continue to put high quality forage as a priority for their farms. Alfalfa, hay, and corn silage production are top priorities for dairy and beef producers. The need for sound forage production and input management remains especially important. Forage production components including establishment, fertilization, pest management, and harvest and storage need to be addressed. Horticulture contributes over $1 million in economic activity to Chippewa County. Fruit crops, greenhouses, and fresh market enterprises make up a majority of the industry. Pest management is a major time commitment and production expense for these industries. Industrial hemp was approved for planting in Wisconsin in 2017 and included in the 2018 Farm Bill signed in December 2018. Farmers and land owners interested in planning industrial hemp have little to no local research and data to make decisions to grow the crop. Plans are to collaborate with Extension UW-Madison researchers and DATCP to provide a research location in Chippewa County.Chippewa, Dunn and Eau Claire counties are developing/implementing a formal specialization program involving the Agriculture and Horticulture educators in these counties. Based on the needs assessment and focus group results as well as the position description, this educator will be responsible for planning and implementing educational programs and services directly related to crop, soil, and farm management in the tri-county area.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
78|STEM for Underserved Audiences (2019)|"When considering the importance of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, many reports speak of job opportunities and economic drivers in a global environment. Research strongly suggests that STEM educational initiatives are not just creating scientists and engineers, but producing STEM literate persons in all areas of the workforce. Eighty percent of the fastest growing occupations in the U.S. require STEM adequacy, and science and technology jobs are projected to grow by 20.6 percent through 2020, more than doubling the 10.1 percent overall U.S. labor force's projected growth (Beatty, National Research Council Committee on Highly Successful Schools or Programs for K-12 STEM Education, National Research Council Board on Science Education, & National Research Council Center for Education, 2011). Additionally, in middle-skill jobs (jobs that require more than a high school diploma, but less than a four year degree), over 67% of openings require, at a minimum, proficiency in productivity software such as Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word and typically other digital literacy skills (Burning Glass Technologies, Captial One, 2015). Overall, it seems clear that middle-skills work has shifted decisively and is now digitally intensive.As a mission mandate, the impacts of STEM educational programming within 4-H have been investigated. Hershberg et al. found that youth in 4-H science programs were nearly two times more likely to participate in science, engineering and computer technology programs during OST (Grades 10 - 12). Additionally, girls who participate in 4-H are two times more likely (Grade 10) and nearly three times more likely (Grade 12) to take part in science programs compared to girls in other OST activities (Hershberg, DeSouza, Warren, Lerner, & Lerner, 2014). Other researchers state that STEM education within 4-H can improve science literacy (Smith, Heck, & Worker, 2012) and build problem solving skills (Daniels et al., 2013).The experiences of racial and ethnic minority students in STEM have become an important element to increasing the scientific and technology workforce in this country. A recent monograph by Museus and colleagues (Museus et al., 2011) provided an in-depth overview of America's changing workforce, and focused on the financial and social benefits of increasing the success rates of students, specifically minority students, in STEM fields. In essence, this work outlined how our technologically-driven economy needs the creativity and manpower that can only be filled by engaging a diverse workforce. Other studies have shown that less than half of the three million students who enter U.S. colleges yearly intending to major in a STEM field persist in STEM until graduation and, furthermore, the exit rate is especially high for the so-called ""underrepresented majority,"" women, racial, and ethnic minorities who are underrepresented in STEM majors but collectively make up 68 percent of college students in the United States (Seymour & Hewitt, 1997). An overwhelming body of research has suggested that underrepresented racial minorities, women, and students of low socioeconomic status persist at lower rates in STEM fields of study than their white, male, and more socioeconomically advantaged counterparts (Bailyn, 2003; Blickenstaff, 2005; Kulis, Sicotte, & Collins, 2002). In addition to the gender and racial disparities in STEM persistence and completion, researchers have highlighted theoretical reasons that students persist in STEM fields of study, such as early exposure to math and science (Adelman, 1999; Kim, Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (U.S.), & Systemic Research Inc., 2006); quality high school curriculum (Elliott, Strenta, Adair, Matier, & Scott, 1996); advanced courses in math and science (Ellington & Prime, 2011); and diverse information on STEM careers (Fadigan & Hammrich, 2004).References:Adelman, C.

80|Water quality programming for farmers (2019)|Water quality research and localized field verification of fertility recommendations provide more specificity on nutrient use and conservation topics for farmers to consider as they modernize practices. Extension's ability to provide research, education and demonstration on this topic empowers farmers to collect and analyze their own data and learn from work done on other farms when presented in educational sessions and materials. It is important for farmers to understand and adapt to using improved practices, and the general public is also benefitted by this through improvement of water resources. Rural populations are especially benefitted by this work because of extensive use of groundwater as water supply and surface water for recreation and other water needs. There are no civil rights factors and implications related to this issue, it affects all populations equally.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
81|2019 Local Governmental Capacity Building: Planning|"ISSUE: There are 23 Towns, 2 Villages and 3 Cities within Oconto County. Each has a Plan Commission of 5 to 7 members in addition to their governmental body of 3 to 5 members. Each election period there is roughly a turnover of 1/3 membership. Interviews detailed how not knowing the job duties makes it difficult to perform duties competently and with confidence. I work with County staff in the Planning and Zoning Department and with State Land Use Specialists providing assistance and trainings to these officials. Additionally, all governments have a Comprehensive Land Use & Economic Development Plan which governs local land use decisions and retains local control. ALL within Oconto County will be out of compliance in 16 months as mandated by the State of Wisconsin. These plans need to be routinely reviewed and updated a minimum of once a year, minor updates once 5 years, and a major update with latest Census information once every 10 years. INVOLVEMENT 20%: UWEX is expertly equipped at providing the facilitated Official's Trainings, and has done so for the last decade. I have a Master's Degree in Urban Planning and have co-taught with Center of Land Use Education in the past. Co-leading with Planning Department will ensure a well thought out approach to meeting state mandates regarding adopting land use plans for each municipality.EQUITY: Rural communities have few dollars to spend on large ""ticket"" mandates such as Land Use planning. Assisting smaller communities identify ways and methods to complete the work themselves will go a long ways in accomplishing the mandate as well as staying affordable. Training local officials on how to conduct themselves and do business will enable them to feel confident in all that they do.Priority Project #1 is the Plan Commission Official TrainingPriority Project #2 is County Wide Planning"|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
82|Volunteer Development (2019)|"Adult volunteers are Wisconsin 4-H's most valuable asset in delivering the quality youth-led, adult guided programs to support youth as they acquire essential life skills. Wisconsin 4-H Youth Development has over 9,650 volunteers who are enrolled as UW-Extension 4-H volunteers working with 30,000 youth enrolled in 4-H programs. In 2018, volunteers reported on average they donated over 58 hours per year. Approximately 72% of Wisconsin 4-H volunteers are female and 28% are male. Nationally, women continue to volunteer at a higher rate than men. (Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. Department of Labor.) In Wisconsin 4-H, approximately 97% of the volunteers are white. WI 4-H Youth Development volunteers currently do not reflect the demographics of most counties.In 2018, Columbia County had 95 adult and 81 youth volunteers. The demographics of volunteers were 75 % female and 25 % male with approximately 99 % of the volunteers being white. Columbia County demographics indicate there is a potential audience of volunteers who reflect Hispanic and Black or African American racial and ethnic groups who are currently not volunteering in 4-H Youth Development.Volunteers play a critical role in the delivery of quality educational programs. In a survey completed January 2015, 4-H Youth Development staff identified Volunteer Development as an area in need of program support. Additionally, a WI 4-H Youth Development Survey was conducted in February 2014 of over 1500 volunteers. Adult volunteers in 4-H indicated relatively low awareness and understanding of some of the educational principles (Essential Elements and the Experiential Learning Process) that are central to the work of 4-H Youth Development. In the 2014 survey, volunteers expressed an interest in learning through not only face-to-face modalities; but also through online-learning such as webinars and podcasts. The 2017 Strategic Plan released by USDA NIFA and National 4-H Council outlines a 4-H Youth Development Vision for 2025. Nationally the following goal has been established ""Youth are surrounded with competent, prepared staff and volunteers."" This goal includes the following outcomes:? ""The 4-H program is supported by a well-trained volunteer force.""? ""4-H staff and volunteers engage in meaningful professional development.""In addition, there is a responsibility of volunteers to ensure access, equity and opportunity. The National 4-H Strategic goal states ""All youth engage in program and opportunities."" To that end it has been identified that ""4-H volunteers and staff are skilled, knowledgeable and prepared to work with all members of their community."" Effective August 15, 2018, a new Columbia County staffing model went into effect when a Positive Youth Development Extension Educator position was filled and the 4-H Program Assistant position was removed. In a late 2017 priority planning process, the Columbia County 4-H Leaders Association identified the following four categories as needing attention: acceptance/welcoming of new families; hands-on learning opportunities; speaking skills and other life skills development; and community service opportunities. In addition, new volunteers and families are requesting meaningful training as well as mentoring families."|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1

While leaders are encouraged to attend Annual Leader Training, historically, the same leaders continue to attend year after year. To become an active volunteer, Taylor County requires mandated reporter training, Volunteer in Preparation (VIP) training, and a criminal background check. There are limited other trainings offered to further support the education of volunteers so they have the opportunity to take on additional roles throughout the local and state 4-H program. Many leaders are only receiving training at the start of their volunteering career through the (VIP) program and there is not a required training after for all leaders. Because of this, 23% of adult volunteers have completed VIP training within the last 5 years, 26% have completed training 5-10 years ago, 46% have completed training more than 10 years ago, and 5% have had no training.

85|Volunteer Development (2019)|"Adult volunteers are Wisconsin 4-H's most valuable asset in delivering the quality youth-led, adult guided programs to support youth as they acquire essential life skills. The 4-H program aims to deliver a research-based program to help youth develop citizenship, leadership and life skills. The 4-H Youth Development Program researchers have identified key elements and approaches that have proven to be effective, and have designed the structure and curriculum of the program around these elements and approaches. These include the Essential Elements of positive youth development, the Experiential Learning Model, and life skills development. All three elements are key factors in successful positive youth development programs. The Essential Elements of positive youth development programming includes:Belonging - Youth need to know they are cared about by others and feel a sense of connection to others in the group.Independence- Youth need to know that they are able to influence people and events through decision-making and action.Mastery- In order to develop self-confidence youth need to feel and believe they are capable and they must experience success at solving problems and meeting challenges.Generosity- Youth need to feel their lives have meaning and purpose (Kress, 2004).Within each 4-H club, project, and activity, these four elements should be embedded across the learning experience. In 2019, Ozaukee County 4-H will focus on two key areas related to ""belonging"". These include evaluating the club environment to determine how it can be more welcoming to new members, and incorporating these principals into camp staff training. In addition to the Essential Elements, Experiential Learning is a key approach to life skill development in youth development programs. Within each 4-H project, a supportive adult helps youth experience learning in their chosen project area. Together they use Experiential Learning to pursue a deeper understanding of the subject, and apply what was learned to other life situations. In 4-H clubs and activities, youth work with an adult mentor to develop life skills through participation and leadership in club events and activities.4-H youth programs promote life skill development through use of a five-step Experiential Learning Model. Experiential Learning occurs when youth are involved in a project or activity in which they:look back at their experience criticallydetermine what was useful or important to rememberuse this new information in real life situationsare encouraged to think, work harder and ultimately learn more thoroughly than is possible through just showing or telling (Pfeiffer & Jones, 1983).A statewide survey of 4-H Leaders was conducted in 2014 to evaluate the degree to which the Essential Elements and Experiential Learning Models were being used to help youth develop life skills. In Ozaukee County, 81 of the 285 registered leaders responded to the survey. The results were as follows: Question: Strongly Disagree Disagree Not Sure Agree Strongly Agree Total Responses I can describe the Essential Elements of Positive Youth Development 10 25 19 23 4 81 I can describe how Life Skills are developed through 4-H projects, activities, and events 4 10 11 41 15 81 I can describe how Experiential Learning is used to work with you in projects, activities or events. 7 18 28 20 8 81 It is clear from the results of the survey that Ozaukee County 4-H Volunteers need to be educated about the key elements and approaches that should be used to effectively help youth develop through the 4-H Youth Development Program. Ongoing training of 4-H Leaders is the key to having the program delivered to youth in the way it was intended. All new 4-H Leaders are trained by the 4-H Youth Development Educator when they initially enroll as a leader. The training is good for life and does not need to be repeated. Of the survey respondents, 68% have been a leader for 5 years or more, and 30% have been a leader for 20 years or more. Many of these leaders were trained in 4-H fundamentals before the Essential Elements and Experiential Learning Models were created. On a positive note, the Ozaukee 4-H Leaders were in the top 5% of response rate to the statewide survey. It is clear from the survey results that ongoing training is needed.References:2014 Survey of WI 4-H Volunteers 4-H Youth Development A 2025 Vision - Source 2017 USDA NIFA and National 4-H Council https://nifa.usda.gov/sites/default/files/resources/National%204-H%20Strategic%20Plan%202017.pdf Kress, C.

86|Community Energy Education and Planning (2019)|Portage County and several of the municipal government units in the area have recently expressed interest in pursuing SolSmart certification. This basically entails updating local provisions planning and permitting to provide greater certainty as to where and how development of solar energy should occur, and to allow for ease of investment and development. Concurrently, several business and community leaders in Plover have expressed interest in emerging financing options available for renewable energy and efficiency projects, possible updates to community plans that may further encourage such investments, and prospects for new housing development that might showcase state-of-the-art design with respect to efficiency. It is estimated that customers located in Plover spend nearly $18 million in a year (2013) on natural gas and electricity. Meanwhile, the 2017 LIFE Report for Portage County indicates that the number of crisis payments via the Wisconsin Home Energy Assistance Program have starkly risen in 2016 and remained quite high in 2016. The report also observe that affordable home energy is a health and safety issue.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
87|Master Gardener Program  (2019)|The Master Gardener Program (MGP) was created nationally in the early 1970's as a way for an extension educator to serve a broader audiences' need in obtaining answers to their gardening questions. The first records of the MGP training in WI appear in the late 70's/early 80's. Since that time, the program has expanded beyond diagnostic services; today's master gardener volunteer activities include establishing native environments and protecting valuable pollinator areas; participating in beautification projects in communities, parks and business districts to aid in placemaking; partnering with our FoodWIse educators to educate low income families on how to grow food; giving educational public presentations on various gardening topics; planting and maintaining gardens that demonstrate science-based gardening recommendations; and doing horticultural therapy-type programming in conjunction with health care, correctional, educational facilities. County MGP coordinators (educators) recruit community members as volunteers, train individuals to increase their capacity on a topic (horticulture), and leverage volunteer efforts to address our educational priorities.To achieve success in this program, educators:? Recruit and train volunteers to increase their capacity in addressing horticultural related issues on behalf of UWEX. ? Support and engage volunteers and leverage their efforts via volunteer development principles, developing community partnerships, and creating/approving projects to assist UWEX address our educational priorities.

88|Addressing the Non-traditional Agricultural Producer |As Richland County continues to see changes in demographics and funding there has been a primary change to the role of the Agriculture agent in Richland County. The county decided to reduce the position to a half time position. Also with in that same time frame Crawford County had a vacancy in its agriculture position. It was then agreed upon to move to a split position were 50% time was in Richland and 50% time in Crawford. The two counties are very similar with regards to its agricultural community. According to the 2012 Census of Agriculture Data, Richland County has 1,260 farms and Crawford County has 1,105. Both counties showed a trend down from the 2007 census. While the number of farms has been decreasing, the average size has increased. Land used for agricultural production is predomantly used for crop production in both counties, with 45% and 49 % percent of Crawford and Richland County's Ag land devoted to crop production. The census data also shows us that market value of the products sold is increasing on Richland County farms as well. As a County, the market value of agricultural products sold in 2012 was $115,451,000 up 37% from the 2007 Census of Agriculture. Looking at the breakdown, Richland County is still heavily reliant on sales generated by livestock and their products (72% of the agricultural sales). While Crawford County is more balanced with 50% of its agricultural sales coming from Livestock sales. A quick overview of the agricultural sector in Richland County shows us that the top agricultural commodities in Richland County by sales are: Milk, Grain, Cattle & Calves, Fruits/ Tree nuts / Berries, and Vegetables. Top Commodities for Crawford County are: Cattle & Calves, Grains, and Hogs and Pigs. While being focused on livestock production, Richland and Crawford Counties offer very diverse landscape with many very small agricultural operations. Utilizing the farm finical data offered by USDA, 70% of Richland County farms and 68% of Crawford County Farms had less than $25,000 in gross sales (2012). Sales of agricultural products in this range are an indication that these producers are not utilizing agriculture as their primary income, and agriculture as a part of their lifestyle. Lifestyle producers view agriculture as a way to supplement their land base, add extra income or enhance their quality of life. From the increase in the number of calls and office visits; it is evident that basic animal husbandry, market development and environmental resources are needed.|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
89|Volunteer Development (2019)|"Adult volunteers are Wisconsin 4-H's most valuable asset in delivering the quality youth-led, adult guided programs to support youth as they acquire essential life skills. Wisconsin 4-H Youth Development has over 9,650 volunteers who are enrolled as UW-Extension 4-H volunteers working with 30,000 youth enrolled in 4-H programs. In 2018, volunteers reported on average they donated over 58 hours per year. Approximately 72% of Wisconsin 4-H volunteers are female and 28% are male. Nationally, women continue to volunteer at a higher rate than men. (Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. Department of Labor.) In Wisconsin 4-H, approximately 97% of the volunteers are white. WI 4-H Youth Development volunteers currently do not reflect the demographics of most counties.In 2018, Door County had 56 adult volunteers. The demographics of volunteers were 80% female and 20% male with approximately 98% of the volunteers being white. Door County demographics indicates there is a potential audience of volunteers who reflect additional racial and ethnic groups who are currently not volunteering in 4-H Youth Development.Volunteers play a critical role in the delivery of quality educational programs. In a survey completed January 2015, 4-H Youth Development staff identified Volunteer Development as an area in need of program support.

To that end it has been identified that ""4-H volunteers and staff are skilled, knowledgeable and prepared to work with all members of their community."" With the generational changes occurring in the volunteer world, the needs and face of volunteers have been shifting. Today's volunteers are no longer the long-term volunteers who are committed solely to one organization. Busy parents and the vast number of volunteer opportunities make recruiting and retaining volunteers more challenging. Training volunteers in this new world also poses challenges. Volunteers are looking for training that is relevant to their role, but also flexible to allow for delivery at a time and place that is convenient for them. A research study from Ouellette et al. (2014) sampled 4-H volunteers in 19 states and found that online instruction was an effective delivery format for introducing information to new volunteer leaders, who appreciated the flexibility and accessibility of the virtual training modules. Another advantage of online instruction modules is that consistent information can be presented to all new and current volunteers on globally important topics, including youth development, teaching and learning, parliamentary procedure, and so forth (Ouellette et al., 2014).By considering flexible training methods, and analyzing new roles for volunteers, 4-H Youth Development can continue to grow and increase the reach of the educational programs."|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1

Our comprehensive poverty rate as obtained from the same data source is 12.8%. The 2010 US Census data reports that 20.3% of the population is >65 year old; 58.4% of the population is between the ages of 18-64; and 21.2% are <18 year old. There are 4 public school districts within the county and 1 private school. The public schools reported free & reduced lunch rates in 2017 ranging from 47.26% - 62.88%, according the WI DPI WISHDash online database.The WI Food Security project data from the 2011-15 report indicates that 16.8% of the population lives in the urban areas within the county; 20.71% of our children live in poverty; 22% of the population rents their home and of those renters 41.86% pay >30% of their income for rent. In addition this report notes that 6% of the eligible population does not own a vehicle; 30% of adults are obese and our county ranked 68th (out of 72) in the County Health rankings for health outcomes and 51st (out of 72)for health factors.According to the WI ACE's study with data from 2011-2015 - 20% of the residents of Washburn County have and ACE score of 4 or more; we have on average 61 hospitalizations from opioid use annually, 46% of the county are classified as ""asset limited, income constrained, employed (ALICE)"". According to the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps organization, a Robert Wood Foundation, ""these ALICE households often live paycheck to paycheck; have little or no savings; struggle to make ends meet and easily are bankrupted by a single medical bill"". In addition 31% of our children live in single parent households and according to the same organization ""adults and children in single-parent households are at risk for adverse health outcomes,"" including an increased likelihood of mental illness, substance abuse and depression. The ACS report also notes that we have 239 grandparents living with grandchildren under the age of 18 and of those 239, 117 are responsible for their grandchildren in Washburn county.All of the data above clearly paints the picture of the high level of stress faced by many of the families living in Washburn County. In addition to the data above the following information has been obtained from stakeholder conversations:There are limited parent education opportunities available for families - as shared by Health and Human Services, both the Head Start programs in the county, and the Family Resource Center. There are no programs to support individuals struggling with their finances to work towards greater independence - Washburn Christian Outreach & Indianhead Community Action Agency (ICAA).In contrast to other areas of the state we have a methamphetamine, marijuana, and alcohol epidemic which is impacting our jail population, schools, families, and is taxing all of our county resources. - County Jail Administration, Sheriff's Department, Health and Human Services, Spooner, Shell Lake, and Northwood School District.Mental Health resources are extremely limited and individuals requiring services often only seek them when in crisis - transportation issues compound the limited access - Washburn Co. Mental Health Task Force, Health and Human Services DirectorBased on the data and stakeholder conversations it is apparent there are two primary issues facing Washburn County: the need for parent, family and relationship based education as well as financial skills education across the lifespan. UW-Extension has a unique position in this county with broad reaching support for comprehensive programming to support the needs of the county residents. The vast amount of resources coupled with our extensive efforts to avoid duplication of services and our efforts to identify gaps in programming has established credibility and high levels of engagement with a wide variety of stakeholders and partners throughout the county. The remaining sections of this document will highlight the work that has been identified as key components in the larger picture of addressing the needs expressed in the data and conversations."|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0
91|Farm and Risk Management (FARM) for 2019|The demographics of the farmers I program with continues to change. The number of active dairy farms is decreasing, while those remaining are either increasing their herd size or diversifying. Farm stress is elevated in Wisconsin and in Taylor County. Due to the current oversupply of milk, dairy processors have stopped accepting milk from Grade B farms and have discontinued accepting milk from some Grade A farms. Prices paid to farmers for milk, meat, corn and other commodities are flat and below their costs of production. Dairy farmers are either looking to exit or to add other enterprises, including cross- breeding their cattle to beef to capture higher prices for marketing beef feeder calves. Some dairy farms are also considering feeding dairy or dairy- beef cattle for the finished beef market.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
92|Farm Safety - Mental and Physical Health|Overall Situation StatementOutagamie County is home to a large population of 180,430 people. The large urban population is mostly centered in the Fox Cities and the surrounding area. The rural areas are close by, just minutes in any direction. We have a thriving agricultural county, whereas in 2016 we had 37,000 cows producing 27,500 pounds of milk per cow. This rates our county in the top 10 milk producing counties in Wisconsin. In 2016, we had a total of 204 herds of dairy cattle, 95% being grade A.Because of this great agriculture base, we have many food processors and agricultural related businesses, which help support our communities, by generating thousands of jobs and millions of dollars of business. Our county residents enjoy the positive impact this has on their household income and local tax revenues. We are diversified in race and ethnicity with residents being 88.6% white, 3.93% Hispanic, 3.19% Asian, 1.57% native, and 1.47% of more than one ethnicity. Spanish is the most common foreign language with 5,489 speakers, followed by a large Hmong population of 3,192 speakers. In 2014, 85.9% of our farms were owned by individuals or families, 7.0% of our farms were owned by family partnerships, 4.9% of our farms were owned by family-owned corporations, and lastly 2.2% of our farms were owned by non-family corporations. Our county is largely family owned farms. The UW-Extension Outagamie County Dairy/Livestock Educator' main programming will focus on dairy, with additional programming reaching out to the needs of the livestock owners. In addition to the species specific programming needs, the general agriculture community will benefit from programming or educational material presented on dairy farm profitability, livestock producer education, and possibly programming on farm stress and farm succession. Along with programming, I reach out to the community, and bring agricultural awareness and education as much as possible. We are at a time in history, whereas most people are 50 years removed from agriculture. To preserve our agriculture lands and lifestyle, I reach out and teach the public about agriculture, answer questions, giving all opportunities to see, touch, smell, and hear everything on a farm. The primary production agriculture focus will be on milk quality, farm modernization or expansion, farms and roads, farm safety, farm profitability and farm succession. I will work with dairy and livestock farms and focus on their specific needs.

93|Volunteer Sustainability and Education 2019|"Adult volunteers are Wisconsin 4-H's most valuable asset in delivering the quality youth-led, adult guided programs to support youth as they acquire essential life skills. Wisconsin 4-H Youth Development has over 9,650 volunteers who are enrolled as UW-Extension 4-H volunteers working with 30,000 youth enrolled in 4-H programs. In 2018, volunteers reported on average they donated over 58 hours per year. Approximately 72% of Wisconsin 4-H volunteers are female and 28% are male. Nationally, women continue to volunteer at a higher rate than men. (Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. Department of Labor.) In Wisconsin 4-H, approximately 97% of the volunteers are white. WI 4-H Youth Development volunteers currently do not reflect the demographics of most counties.In 2018, Barron County had 180 adult volunteers. The demographics of volunteers were 69 % female and 31% male with approximately 99% of the volunteers being white. Barron County demographics indicates there is a potential audience of volunteers who reflect other racial and ethnic groups who are currently not volunteering in 4-H Youth Development.Volunteers play a critical role in the delivery of quality educational programs. In a survey completed January 2015, 4-H Youth Development staff identified Volunteer Development as an area in need of program support. Additionally, a WI 4-H Youth Development Survey was conducted in February 2014 of over 1500 volunteers. Adult volunteers in 4-H indicated relatively low awareness and understanding of some of the educational principles (Essential Elements and the Experiential Learning Process) that are central to the work of 4-H Youth Development. In the 2014 survey, volunteers expressed an interest in learning through not only face-to-face modalities; but also through online-learning such as webinars and podcasts. The 2017 Strategic Plan released by USDA NIFA and National 4-H Council outlines a 4-H Youth Development Vision for 2025. Nationally the following goal has been established ""Youth are surrounded with competent, prepared staff and volunteers."" This goal includes the following outcomes: ""The 4-H program is supported by a well-trained volunteer force."" ""4-H staff and volunteers engage in meaningful professional development.""In addition, there is a responsibility of volunteers to ensure access, equity and opportunity. The National 4-H Strategic goal states ""All youth engage in program and opportunities."" To that end it has been identified that ""4-H volunteers and staff are skilled, knowledgeable and prepared to work with all members of their community."" Youth leadership requires development programs and tools to educate young people to reach their full potential and be successful. Wisconsin 4-H offers programs to aid in this process. In order for this process to be successful, adult volunteers and community members need to work together to sustain these programs in order to help youth grow and learn.Barron County had 208 4-H Adult Volunteers in 2017. This number has dropped in 2018 to 180 adult volunteers. While some of the drop in numbers can be attributed to an increased amount of confusion about the background check process, this information does create an opportunity to engage new volunteers and re-educate the existing long term volunteers. Barron County has always been a volunteer strong county with 4-H programming. Just to name a few, this past year we celebrated 50, 30, and 25 year mile stones with some of our volunteers. Traditional 4-H runs deep with many of our volunteers and families. We can also celebrate new adults volunteering with 145 of the 180 volunteers in 2018 celebrating 1 or 5 year involvement with the 4-H program compared to only 20 volunteers in 2017 celebrating 1 or 5 year involvement. This data shows that new adult volunteers are becoming involved and need to have quality training and engagement to help shape our youth and stay connected with the Wisconsin 4-H Mission. Between community clubs and special interest programs, 486 youth were enrolled in 4-H. Adult volunteers lead training sessions, programs, project activities, and leadership events to support 4-H youth in the Barron County Community. Connecting the dots from the 4-H Adult Leaders to our 4-H Youth is an important role for Wisconsin 4-H to play.To create the strongest youth/adult partnership for our program, it is important that adults are provided with the knowledge, training, and skills to help youth be as successful as possible. In order to meet this goal, thorough communication and education are vital in this process. Finding the best ways to communicate with leaders and ensure that they are provided the best education for the 4-H Youth is imperative."|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
94|Fostering Health & Wellness in Waukesha County|"The World Health Organization defines health as ""a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.""1 A multitude of factors influence the health behaviors and environment that affect the health of both the individual and the community at large. The Social Ecological Model will provide the framework for considering the educational programming being provided.2 The Social Ecological Model explains how personal health choices are influenced by factors at multiple levels, and how efforts directed solely at changing a person's behavior may not be effective. All people are exposed to relationships, worksites and institutions, and communities that may or may not support healthy lifestyle choices. When programming provides supportive influences at multiple levels (i.e. personal knowledge/belief systems, interpersonal, organizational, policy), also known as a systems approach, greater success towards more positive health behaviors can be achieved.Located just west of Milwaukee County, Waukesha County is the third largest county, by population, in Wisconsin. Waukesha County has a number of very positive socioeconomic and health indicators. Residents' median household income ($78,689) is the second highest in the state. (It should be noted that minority households have a markedly lower median income: Black households $31,865 & Hispanic households $55,123.) Waukesha County has a high school completion rate of 94%, compared to 88% for the state of Wisconsin. Additionally, 80% of adults ages 25-44 reporting some post-secondary education. Unemployment (3.8%) is lower in Waukesha County than for the State of Wisconsin (4.6%). The poverty rate in Waukesha (4.7%) is also lower than the State (12.0%) poverty rate. Waukesha County has a lower ratio of primary care physicians and dentists per resident than the state as a whole. The vast majority of Waukesha County residents also have some form of health insurance, with only 5% being uninsured, compared to 10% for the state (County Health Rankings and Roadmaps).Waukesha County is also changing rapidly. Between 2000 and 2010 the minority populations approximately doubled in the county. The Hispanic population grew from 9503 residents to 16,123 residents. The Black population increased from 2646 residents to 4914 residents, and the Asian population increased from 5381 residents to 10,721 residents. This increase in minority populations is also highlighted by the decrease in percentage of the white population in the county. In 2000, 95.8% of the county residents were white, whereas in 2010, 93.3% of the population was white (US Census Bureau). Similar to the state and nation, Waukesha County is rapidly aging. In 2010, approximately 1 out of 7 (14.7%) of residents in Waukesha County was age 65 or older (US Census Bureau). It is projected that by 2030, nearly one in four (24.6%) will be age 65 years or older (Applied Population Laboratory). This demographic trend has multiple noteworthy implications related to an aging population base including health issues (particularly chronic disease), social issues (e.g., social isolation), housing, transportation, and long-term care. Of particular concern is the high rate of fall fatalities among residents age 65 and older in Waukesha County. According to data cited by the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps, Waukesha County has a fall fatality rate for older adults (ages 65+) of 165 per 100,000 population, as compared to the State of Wisconsin, which has a fall fatality rate of 123 per 100,000. Only Milwaukee County has more total fall fatalities than Waukesha County, and only six other Wisconsin counties have a higher fall rate. As with the rest of the nation, obesity is a significant health issue among Waukesha County residents. According to recent data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) of the CDC, 28% of adult Waukesha County residents are obese.3 While there are no data for Waukesha County, nationally both adults and children with disabilities have higher obesity rates than adults and children without disabilities (CDC, https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/obesity.html). According to the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps, 93% of the population has access to exercise opportunities, but 16% of the adult population reports engaging in no leisure time physical activity. According to statistics from the CDC, non-Hispanic white adults are more likely to meet the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines than non-Hispanic black adults and Hispanic adults. However, the rate of physical activity even among non-Hispanic whites is still very low, with only 23% meeting the Physical Activity Guidelines nationally. Multiple entities have conducted community needs assessments in the county. The following table lists the date of the most recent needs assessment and the resulting priority areas that each organization is targeting.Organization Year of Report Priority Areas Waukesha County CHIPP (County Health Improvement Plan Process) 2016-2020 2017 Mental health Opioids Nutrition & physical activity Aurora Medical Center Summit (Summit, WI) 2015 Access and coverage, including mental health Chronic disease - hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and alcohol/substance use Cancer prevention and treatment Injury prevention - falls prevention and workforce development Community Action Coalition for South Central Wisconsin 2013 For those living in poverty the needs are: Affordable housing Education/skills training Access to healthcare Transportation to work Food assistance Community Memorial Hospital of the Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin (Menomonee Falls, WI) 2015 Access to care and navigation Mental health/alcohol and other drug abuse Chronic disease management ProHealth Care (Waukesha, WI) 2016 Needs of the elderly   Mental health issues including depression, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease   AODA -adverse effects from polypharmacy   Prevalence of chronic conditions   Accidental injury   Social vulnerability and isolation   Obesity   Access issues including scarcity of providers specializing in gerontology AODA issues   Binge drinking   Prescription drug overdose/misuse   Heroin and opioid deaths/hospitalizations   Access including scarcity of providers Mental health   Suicide rate   Alzheimer's disease   Depression   Access including scarcity of providers Center for Urban Population Health (located in Milwaukee, but prepared for Waukesha County from funding from Aurora Health Care, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Columbia St Mary's, Froedtert Health, ProHealth Care, & Wheaton Franciscan Health) 2015 Mental Health Alcohol & Drugs Chronic Disease Access to Health Care Physical Activity Education Financial Stability Individuals feel better about themselves, have fewer health issues, and have greater ability to handle life's challenges when they are physically active and eating well. Developing the capacity to purposefully and mindfully manage life's stressful situations has been shown to positively affect an individual's mental/emotional and physical health. Additionally, the senior population in the county continues to increase, mirroring the booming senior population nationwide. Educational programming in the area of health and wellness, with an emphasis on supporting the aging population's health and quality of life, will complement other initiatives in the county that are working to produce a healthier, more resilient population with fewer health, mental health, and AODA issues. 1 Constitution of the World Health Organization.

95|2019 4-H Volunteer Development|Rock County 4-H volunteers are essential to the success of our county's 4-H program. More than 330 4-H volunteers partner with 4-H youth to lead, teach, involve, mentor and guide clubs, projects, activities and serve as officers in the county's adult leaders' chartered organization. The vision that today's 4-H volunteers embrace will provide 4-H members the opportunity to build skills, confidence, empathy, independence and relationships with others in 4-H and our worldwide community. 4-H members model 4-H volunteers' actions; therefore, it's imperative that all 4-H volunteers have the opportunity to engage in professional educational development to enable them to help provide the best education opportunities for the youth involved in Rock Co. 4-H. Currently, many 4-H club volunteers struggle with meeting deadlines as well as completing required paperwork to apply for 4-H Club Charters. Project leaders at the club and county levels don't know what the expectations are for their roles. Leadership in the county's adult leaders' organization continues to be a top-down model instead of partnering with youth and local clubs. Therefore, all aspects of 4-H volunteer leader roles and education are a top priority for me to provide educational opportunities for Rock Co. 4-H volunteers.|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1
96|Strengthening Communities and Families|"The second priority area focuses on strengthening communities and families, with a focus on both one-time interventions (e.g. workshops and classes) as well as collaboration with family-serving agencies in the county for greater impact.Parenting classes will be important to support parents and caregivers' ability to understand child development and to face stressors such as poverty and single parenthood need support to cope. Parental stress has been linked to negative child outcomes, including child abuse. Last year, Waupaca County had 50 cases of child abuse, a prevalence rate of 4.3%. Child abuse affects the physical and mental health of a child and has long-term detrimental outcomes. Parent-child relationships are important to address. Curriculum such as Raising a Thinking Child, Strengthening Families and other family/relationship workshops are a common response to community needs in Extension work. Thus, the target audience will primarily be parents and caregivers with limited resources.Addressing well-being means taking into consideration factors influencing families in a larger context, including greater collaboration with other program areas and the community. The FLE has strong relationships with stakeholders through coalition work. She will continue to network and collaborate with area coalitions such as Mission of Hope-Waupaca and the Suicide Prevention Coalition to share resources, offer evidence-based information and the perspective of an Extension educator. Finally, another new relatively new program that has been a significant portion of Liang's work is Building Bridges across Communities, an initiative to build leadership in the growing Latino/Hispanic families in Waupaca County. Waupaca County's Latino/Hispanic population has grown significantly over the past decade, and is estimated to be around 3% (US Census, 2010). In the past year, the county office decided to make a concerted effort to build trust with the Latino/Hispanic community. Project ""Building Bridges across Communities"" seeks to build trust between UW-Extension, non-profits, and underserved audiences through cross-cultural family-centered programming."|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
97|Cooking with Children and Families (2019)|In recent years there has been a resurgent cultural interest in learning how to cook and an increasing number of community-based food preparation (cooking) classes occurring across the country. Cooking meals in the home is associated with healthier dietary choices, such as increased fruit, vegetable, and whole grain consumption, than meals consumed outside of the home.1,2 This is especially relevant for individuals with limited incomes as they are more likely to have poor diet quality, and poor diet quality is a risk factor for obesity and other adverse health outcomes.3 Numerous cooking skills programs target children and parents with limited incomes and research indicates that these programs increase confidence in cooking, improve fruit and vegetable consumption, and improve vegetable variety and home availability of vegetables.4,5 While many programs target parents and/or children independently, the combination of parents and children learning and preparing meals together may further enhance cooking self-efficacy and diet quality for both children and parents.6 In addition to short- and medium-term positive outcomes, there is evidence that adequate cooking skills in adolescence predicts long-term indicators of nutrition, such as preparing meals in the home, frequent family meals, greater vegetable consumption, and lower fast food consumption.7In response to this research and increased interest from FoodWIse colleagues, FoodWIse state specialists Betsy Kelley, Gayle Coleman, and Emily Latham developed and delivered a hands-on food preparation training to all FoodWIse Coordinators and Educators in the summer of 2017. The overall goal of the training was to provide all FoodWIse staff with a baseline knowledge of food preparation and to equip them with the skills to facilitate food preparation activities as part of direct education. In FY18, food preparation activities were limited to youth in grades 6-12, utilizing the curriculum Teen Cuisine, and to parents and caregivers of young children. Over 700 FoodWIse participants were engaged in hands-on food preparation lessons and over 500 participants were reached using Teen Cuisine. A revised and updated version of Teen Cuisine was made available in the fall of 2018 and statewide funding was provided for every educator to purchase cooking equipment, thus an increase in the number of participants engaged in hands-on food preparation is expected in FY19.FoodWIse state specialists acknowledge the need to continue to support and expand efforts to reach new audiences with hands-on food preparation activities. Specifically, engaging elementary age children and families in experiential nutrition education that includes cooking. References:1. Mclaughlin C, Tarasuk V, Kreiger N.

98|Master Gardener Volunteer Training|The national Master Gardener Program (MGP) was created in the early 1970's as a way for an Extension educator to serve broader audiences' needs in obtaining answers to their gardening questions. The first records of MGP training in WI date back to the late 1970's/early 80's. Since that time, the program has expanded beyond diagnostic services; today's volunteer activities also include establishing native environments and protecting pollinator resources; creating beautification/green space projects in communities, parks, schools and business districts to aid in placemaking and create outdoor classrooms that demonstrate science-based gardening recommendations; partnering with FoodWIse educators to educate low income families on how to grow food; giving public educational presentations on various gardening topics; and doing horticultural therapy-type programming in conjunction with health care, correctional, educational and homeless/low income housing facilities. I recruit community members in Dane County as volunteers, train individuals to increase their capacity regarding horticultural topics and techniques, and leverage volunteer efforts to address Extension's educational priorities.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
99|Food Security |"Access to ""adequate, appropriate, and safe foods and nutrition"" means the regular and sufficient consumption of nutritious foods across the life span. Common health concerns related to food and nutrition include food security (hunger), overweight/obesity rates, and food safety.According to the most recent United Way L.I.F.E. (Leading Indicators for Excellence, 2018) findings, nearly 8% of Fond du Lac residents experience poverty. The American Community Survey (2013-2017) report an 8.5% poverty rate. This number is higher for children, at 11% (ACS, 2017.) The Wisconsin Food Security Project (2018) has a predicted food security rate for Fond du Lac County of 10% for the total population and 16% for children. The most recent community health assessment found that 6% of surveyed adults reported hunger in the past year. Fifteen percent of Fond du Lac residents participate in FoodShare and 41% of the student population are eligible for the free/reduced lunch program. There is a growing body of evidence proving the connection between food insecurity and obesity. The Food and Research Action Center (2015) explains the ""coexistence of food insecurity and obesity is expected given that both are consequences of economic and social disadvantage."" While all segments of the population are affected by obesity, low-income individuals are especially prone to the health effects associated with lack of healthy foods. According to the L.I.F.E. report, Fond du Lac County experienced a significant increase from 2010 to 2015 when looking at low income and low access to supermarkets. Equitable access to healthy foods is an even bigger concern in Fond du Lac County than in the past."|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0

102|Community Engaged Leadership|This area of emphasis focuses on youth cultivating the habits and skills necessary for political participation in a democratic society and taking individual and collective action to identify and address issues of public concern.4-H Youth Development prioritizes learning by doing to maximize positive youth development outcomes. Successful strategies include: building youth/adult partnership practices into community decision-making, whether within the 4-H organization or in other community settings, from community coalitions to organizational boards and committees. Resources to inform these practices can be found at https://fyi.uwex.edu/youthadultpartnership/ facilitating action planning processes, by which youth can address community issues, either in youth-led spaces with adult coaching or in partnerships with adults working on the same issues. Resources for action planning have been developed for the Tech Changemakers program (https://fyi.uwex.edu/wi4hcitizenship/research-resources/) and the FoodWIse/4-H Youth Development Youth Action for Community Health project) creating opportunities for youth input and decision-making including Teen Courts where youth enact restorative justice, opportunities for youth to serve as advisors on local government boards (Youth in Governance), etc. where they can build relationships with and inform adult decision-makers, youth input into community development through participation in planning process, etc. These opportunities help youth to build understanding of community issues and their civic roles.Youth who participate in these types of opportunities develop habits that make civic participation as adults much more likely. In Wisconsin, we have also seen evidence that youth develop an appreciation for the communities where they live and develop supportive relationships with community adults. Outcomes for communities of youth civic engagement include greater economic and social development that includes young people in all aspects of community life. Key practices developed by the Engaging Young People to Sustain Communities include empowering more diverse community leadership, increasing social capital, and strengthening sense of community and sense of place (see, for example, https://blogs.ces.uwex.edu/engaging-youth/files/2015/02/EYP-White-Paper-February-2015.pdf). These outcomes are particularly important for groups that are marginalized from community leadership due to race, class, or other characteristics.In the most recent Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 62.7% of youth strongly agree or agree that they feel like they belong at their school. 72.1% of students who reported having at least one teacher or other adult in their school that they can talk to if they had a problem. In the most recent general election, Marathon County had 85% of registered voters vote. (Marathon County). 62% of the voting age population voted. In the recent Marathon County LIFE Report, 55% of respondents said they were satisfied or very satisfied with how welcoming the community is.

103|Early Care and Education Programming (2019)|Recent research indicates that the prevalence of childhood obesity is not declining as some reports previously suggested.1 In fact, there has been a significant increase in severe obesity among children ages 2-5 years old.1 Additionally, the prevalence of obesity among African American children and Hispanic children is significantly higher than that of White children.1 Diet quality also remains a concern for children, particularly those under the age of 12 years. While fruit intake increased over the past five years, children are not eating vegetables as frequently.2 For children from low-income households, both fruit and vegetable consumption decreased over the past five years.2 It is important that children ages 2-11 achieve a healthy weight by developing healthy eating habits and engaging in physical activity.3 Encouraging children to accept and consume new foods can take as many as 10 repeated exposures.4In addition, 61% of young children ages 3-6 years old who are not yet in kindergarten are in center-based care arrangements (2012).5 The high percentage of children in early care and education (ECE) settings presents an opportunity to influence healthy eating and physical activity behaviors. In fact, ECE settings are proven to be effective settings for obesity prevention interventions.6 Specifically, research illustrates that nutrition education programs, such as Color Me Healthy, increase fruit and vegetable consumption among children ages 4-5 years old.7 Additionally, the Nutrition and Physical Activity Self-Assessment for Child Care (NAPSACC) is a policy, systems, and environmental change intervention aimed at improving the nutrition and physical activity environments of child care centers and is associated with a reduction in children's body mass index.8Historically, reaching children under the age of five years with direct education in ECE settings was not a focus for FoodWIse. However, in Fiscal Year 2018, 7.8% of FoodWIse's total participants were under the age of five years. This percentage is much higher than would be expected given our program delivery models. Education with this audience is occurring in ECE settings (32%) and in schools (62%), possibly through 4K programs. Additionally, education with children under the age of five is reaching a much higher percentage of Black/African American (FY17: 15.76%) and Hispanic (FY17: 21.07%) children than is represented statewide by the Wisconsin Demographic Data from the U.S. Census (6.6% and 6.7% respectively). FoodWIse is uniquely situated to reach diverse children from low-income households with nutrition education and policy, systems, and environmental change projects to increase acceptance and consumption of healthy foods and to improve the food and physical activity environment in ECE settings.

104|Management of Cropping Systems (2019)|"In early 2018, a short needs assessment was sent out to 48 individuals consisting of dairy farmers, beef farmers, vegetable and fruit producers, government agencies, and private agriculture industry. Ten replies were returned. Although the response rate was low two themes of land conservation practices and pasture management practices emerged from the needs assessment.In the 2007 USDA Census of Agriculture, 22% of the farms in Langlade and 18% of the farms in Lincoln reported using some sort of conservation practice. Presently farmers are becoming more aware of the need for soil conservation as concern from the general community grows regarding non-point pollution sources of nutrients to public waters. With the short growing season and the unpredictability of fall weather, further examination of which cover crop, timing of planting, and method of planting needs to be completed in order to make recommendations that fit within the area's growing season and cropping rotations. To aid in this I am currently assisting AgSource Cooperative with their cover crop research trials at the Langlade County Research Station and presented at the annual Antigo Flats Producer Group meeting in 2017 and 2018. I am also working with the University of Wisconsin Nutrient and Pest Management Program to develop studies to further examine which cover crops fit the growing season and rotation and if there are other uses for the covers such as forage. Additionally, teaching farmers to use nutrient management plans, specifically SNAP Plus computer software, to assist them in making decisions on crop rotations and tillage practices are best used to reduce soil erosion and nutrient runoff. According the USDA Census of Agriculture, from 2007 to 2012 the percentage of cropland acres receiving fertilizer increased 3% in Lincoln County and 7% in Langlade County. During the same time period, Lincoln County had a 16% increase in the number of acres receiving manure and Langlade County a 22% increase in acres with a manure application. The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection reported in 2012, Lincoln County had 9% or 3442 of cropland acres and Langlade County has 45% or 32,891 cropland acres in a nutrient management plan. As of 2018, the percent of cropland acres has increased to 18% in Lincoln County and 70% in Langlade County. To continue the growth in acres I partnered with the Langlade County Conservation Department in 2018 to nutrient management planning workshops. During the workshops I presented on concepts of nutrient management planning and worked one on one with producers to assist them in writing and submitting a finished nutrient management plan. Further programming in nutrient management planning needs to continue to serve as a tool for farmers to use as they plan their tillage and fertilizing strategies for the next growing season.Although many may not think of grazing as a conservation practice, in an October 2015 eXtension article titled ""Pasture Management for Small Farms"" it stated that ""manure ultimately will either be incorporated into the pasture soil or if the pasture is poorly vegetated it may be a runoff risk."" One method a producer may use to promote vegetation to prevent runoff is to implement a managed grazing system. Managed grazing moves the animals through paddocks to allow the forage grasses and legumes time to rest and restore energy which in turn improves forage quality and persistence. The USDA Census of Agriculture reported that from 2007 to 2012 permanent pasture acres increased 6% in Lincoln County with 7196 acres and Langlade County with 6528 acres. During that time period Lincoln County reported a decrease from 112 to 88 farms using a managed grazing system. Langlade County also reported a decrease from 70 to 38 of farms using a managed grazing system. Langlade County reported to the USDA Wisconsin National Agriculture Statistics Service an increase of 15% cattle and calves from 17,000 to 19,900 and a 5% increase of dairy cattle from 7500 to 7700 from 2012 to 2018. In that same time period Lincoln County a decrease in dairy cattle but a 3% increase in cattle and calves from 11,800 to 12,100. As cattle numbers continue to increase programming on pasture management will need to be developed to assist these producers in producing high quality forages that will utilize the nutrients supplied through manure deposited and supplemental fertilizer applications. In 2018, I collaboration with the Langlade County Conservation Department and the USDA Lincoln and Langlade Counties Natural Resources Conservation Office to develop and host pasture walks throughout the growing season. I lead the discussion proper soil testing methods for pasture systems, methods on how to measure pasture yield, and manure management while winter feeding cattle using round bales."|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
105|Financial security|Kenosha County sits in the southeastern corner of Wisconsin; it is a fairly central location in between Milwaukee, WI and Chicago, IL and considered to be part of the Chicago metropolitan, Chicagoland, area. In the recent and coming years, Kenosha County has seen and will continue to see marked growth of population. The population of Kenosha County was estimated to be 168,521 in 2017[1] and is currently projected to be 200,620 by 2030.[2] It is important to address current health issues within the existing population, as well as think about the coming influx of residents. In 2018, Kenosha County ranked 59 of 72 Wisconsin counties for Health Outcomes (length and quality of life) and 66 of 72 for Health Factors (health behaviors, clinical care, social & economic factors, and physical environment). [3] As the county's population continues to expand, addressing facets to enhance the overall health of our residents is imperative. Kenosha County has fairly defined lines and areas that can be described as 'urban,' 'suburban,' and 'rural.' Understanding these portions of the county exist are important in ensuring all sectors of the population are reached, as lifestyles within these areas have a lot of variance.Well-being is a driving force of a person's ability to cope with and prosper in life. There are many elements which contribute to the overall well-being of an individual, family, and community. Behavioral health of the community can set the stage for residents' success and safety within the area. Kenosha County is in the midst of reframing their Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP), 'Healthy People Kenosha County' for the coming years of 2020-2025. In late 2018, one of the three identified areas of concern was determined to be mental health. This topic has emerged to be an understood important facet of a strong community. Behavioral health has recently been identified as a program area for the Health & Well-Being Institute, with underscores of mental health (social/emotional well-being) and substance use prevention.Attaining financial well-being is a personal state and is not only defined by measurements. It is having financial security and freedom of choice. Cost of living in Kenosha as it is now and in the future has been a concern for residents living close to or under poverty thresholds. Kenosha County's median prices for homes and rental units continues to climb, as the county population and demand for housing climbs. Standards say only 30% of income should go toward collective housing costs; however, area median rent is $884 and rising. In 2016, Kenosha County had an eviction rate of 3.47%, which was the second highest county rate in the state, only behind neighboring Racine County. [4] Rent burden and general financial security holds people back from being able to plan for emergencies, save money, pay household bills, repair credit, among other things. Food is a necessity of life for everyone. It is the fuel that contributes to the ability to learn, work, and play. Food insecurity is the lack of assured access to enough food for a healthy and active life and is tied to a person's financial security in many ways. According to the UW-Madison Applied Population Lab, Wisconsin Food Security Project, Kenosha County holds an 11.2% rate of food insecurity of its residents, with an 18.6% rate for children specifically.[5] These rates are slightly higher than state rates of 11% and 17% respectively. UW-Extension has a history in working to strengthen food security across the state. The foundation for food security includes: communities that support economic well-being, strong federal food and nutrition programs, adequate access to and availability of safe, healthy, and affordable food, and a strong and accessible emergency/charitable food safety net. Meeting with potential partners and stakeholders in the community has been imperative, as Kenosha County's Extension office did not previously have an equivalent position (formerly Family Living) for a number of years and many did not have a frame of reference for possible programming. Through gathering input from community stakeholders, participating in the Area 22 Developmental Situational Analysis, and input from Kenosha County's Extension Education Committee, initial programming areas have been identified to be social/emotional well-being, financial security, and food security.

Outreach has included Caregiver cafes' , resource fairs and other outreach method to reach families and individuals that are seeking resources to enhance their family needs. Specific community outreach has occurred in local communities. Working with the Village of Hortonville, there has been specific attention given to more resources being made available to seniors. Transportation issues, Food accessibility and outreach to community partners to increase resources to Seniors.

107|Addressing Farm productivity and profitability|Fertile soils have allowed Columbia County to be in the top 10 for production for corn grain. The fertile soils support a variety of enterprises - from large cash grain operations of 1,000 plus acres to 10 acre fresh market vegetable producers. Included in these totals are 109,200 acres of corn grain, 21,800 acres of corn silage, 49,000 acres of soybeans, 2,800 acres of oats, 7,400 acres of winter wheat, 19,800 acres of alfalfa hay, plus many acres of pasture, potatoes, sweet corn peas, carrots, onions and other vegetables according to the 2018 Wisconsin Agricultural Statistics. Survey results from Columbia County Corn growers identified the need for updated information to be able to adopt new techniques and practices available to them to achieve high levels of production and also to adapt to a changing market environment in order to maintain high profitability. Columbia County Land Conservation Department provides stipends for farmers to receive Nutrient Management update training each year and stipends for new farmers to be trained to write their own nutrient management plans, to assist with UW-Extension Educational Programming.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
108|Diet & Exercise|Thirty-one percent of adult residents in Wisconsin are obese (County Health Rankings, 2018.) Fond du Lac County has surpassed the state with 37% adult obesity and 73% adult overweight, which both have increased since 2014. The 2017 Fond du Lac County Community Health Assessment found the increasing rates of obesity and percentage of overweight as one of the 10 most pressing health concerns in the county.Among all of the health issues facing society today, obesity has clearly become one of the most pressing. It has been directly linked to increased rates of chronic disease, premature death and increased medical costs. Studies have shown that specific health behaviors have been clearly linked to obesity prevention. They include: consumption of fruits and vegetables, limiting consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, limiting consumption of large portion sizes and energy-dense foods, and physical activity. Overall health behaviors for Fond du Lac County ranked 30 out of 72 (1 being the healthiest; 72 the unhealthiest) (County Health Rankings, 2018.)There are several social, economic, physical and environmental health determinants related to obesity, including access and quality of food, levels of physical activity, and health behavior. The Public Health Department's Healthy 2020 Steering Committee and Living Well Coalition are current local prevention efforts in Fond du Lac County. Most recently, these groups have taken special interest in examining the effects that social and economic indicators have on health (e.g. food insecurity and access, poverty, race/ethnicity, etc.) by identifying Social Determinants of Health as an overarching priority.|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0
109|High Quality Membership Programs|Research shows that high quality programs are more likely to foster positive youth developmental outcomes. High quality programs are characterized by 4 key elements: (1) safe, inclusive, and welcoming environment, (2) supportive and caring adults, (3) content that simultaneously challenges and sparks passion and interest, and (4) high levels of youth voice in program decision making. Together, these elements promote youth engagement, and in turn, the developmental and practical skills for youth to succeed. Regardless of the type of program (in-school, after-school, on-going, or sporadic), programs that focus on maximizing each of the high quality elements are more likely to be engaging for participants.These key elements are especially important for 4-H and Extension-based Positive Youth Development programs because each element is within the control of program educators and participants. The elements can change and improve over time. By monitoring and evaluating each of the key elements, program leaders can adapt and improve the program to maximize positive youth development outcomes for all participants. Research with 4-H members nationally has shown that programs that implement these elements contribute to positive developmental outcomes including: 1) academic motivation and success, 2) social competence, 3) personal standards, 4) contributions to others, 5) connections to others, and 6) personal responsibility. In turn, these developmental outcomes in the longer term contribute to increased academic and vocational success, civic engagement, economic stability, and overall wellbeing.https://health.oregonstate.edu/sites/health.oregonstate.edu/files/thriving-model/pdf/2018-thriving-model-summary-booklet.pdf|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1
110|Enhancing Dairy and Livestock Production (2019)|"Agriculture is an integral part of Dodge County and ranks 6th in the state for the total value of agricultural products. The market value of livestock, poultry, and their products sold in Dodge County is $202.5 million, accounting for 54% of the $373.4 billion total agricultural products sold in the county. The Dodge County agricultural accounts for $2.86 billion in economic activity, 34% of the counties total economic activity. Every dollar of sales from agricultural products generates an additional $0.44 of economic activity in other parts of the county's economy. Agriculture additionally contributes $761 million to the counties total income (21.7% of the counties total income), and pays $37.1 million in local and state taxes. According to the 2012 Census of Agriculture, there were 2,012 farms in the Dodge County, of which the principle operators are 92% male/ 8% female, with the average age of the principle operator being 57.6 years old. 85.7% of farms are owned by individuals or families, 7.7% by family partnerships, 4.2% by family owned corporations and 2.4% by non-family corporations and other business enterprises. Meaning 97.6 % of Dodge County farms are family owned. Farmers own and manage 402,021 acres, or 72% of the land in Dodge County. 54,060 acers are used for forage land including all hay, haylage, grass silage, and green chop. One hundred and fifty five Dodge County farms generate $1,303,000 in direct-marketing sales to customers. Agriculture provides jobs for 9,855 county residents, about 19% of the county's 49,743 workforce. DairyDairy is the major agricultural industry in Dodge County, consistently ranking as one of the top ten milk-producing counties in Wisconsin. In 2012, the market value of the on-farm production and sale of milk accounted for $149.2 million. On-farm milk production accounts for 918 jobs, and dairy processing provides 3,870 jobs in Dodge County. In 2017, there were 241 dairy farms in Dodge County a decrease from 257 herds in 2016. 99% or 239 herds are grade ""A"" certified herds. These farms contained on average through the year 40,000 cows producing an average of 25000 pounds of milk per cow. While cow numbers in 2017 remained stable compared to 2016, milk production per cow was up 1,200 lbs. resulting in 1 million lbs. of milk produced in Dodge County. On-farm milk production accounts for 918 jobs, and dairy processing accounts for 3,870 jobs. Many Dodge County dairy farms are on the forefront of the dairy industry, with multiple farms utilizing robotic milkers, and value added productions. Dodge County is home to seven milk plants - producing retail milk, Ice cream, a variety of cheeses, cheese spreads and snack dips. The county is home to the Dodge County Dairy Herd Improvement Association, and East Central Select Sires. The county Holstein association also supports a very active and competitive Junior Holstein Association. LivestockDodge County consistently ranks among the top five for livestock such as hogs and pigs, and chukars. Additionally, it ranks in as one of the top ten counties in cattle and calves and pheasants in Wisconsin. In 2017, Dodge County is home to 105,000 cattle and calves an increase of 5,000 from 2016, 19,000 hogs and pigs. Dodge County farmers also raise; chickens, alpacas, bees, whitetail deer, and aquaculture. An area of interest and concern for dairy and livestock producers in Dodge County is remaining profitable. In a needs assessment done in 2016-2017 Dairy producers indicated that animal wellbeing / herd health, nutrition, herd management / record keeping, dairy facilities, heifer development, and reproduction/genetics were viewed as areas farmers were interested in receiving additional education. While livestock producers indicated nutrition, animal wellbeing / herd health, herd management / record keeping, housing / facilities, and quality assurance. All the elements of a farm listed previously are essential to creating a profitable/ long lasting farm business. Therefore, this agent will focus on providing support and education to producers looking to create a profitable farm business. Efforts for programming will focus on animal wellbeing, young stock development (genetics, reproduction, and health), herd management, and facilities."|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
111|Farm Financial Health and Management (2019)|"Situation Statement: Agriculture in Oconto and Marinette Counties:Agriculture is a key contributor to Oconto and Marinette Counties' economy. According to ""Oconto County Agriculture: Value and Economic Impact"" (Deller, 2014), agriculture provides 4,193 jobs and $126.4 million to the county's income. Dairy is Oconto County's leading agricultural sector. In 2012, 154 dairy farms housing 20,100 dairy cows, contributed $97.3 million to the local economy in on-farm milk production and milk sales. In addition to dairy production; grain, cattle and calves, and vegetable production drive approximately $1.3 billion in economic activity in Oconto County (United States Department of Agriculture National Agriculture Statistics Survey (USDA NASS, 2012)). During the same time period, Marinette County had 66 dairy farms housing 11,800 dairy cows and contributing $55.1 million to the local economy in on-farm milk production and milk sales (USDA NASS, 2012).Oconto and Marinette Counties have a formal specialization agreement allowing the county's agriculture agents to specialize in dairy and livestock (Oconto County) or agronomy and horticulture (Marinette County). The agents collaborate on educational programming where appropriate. The specialization agreement provides farmers, home gardeners, and agribusinesses in both counties specialized technical advice and assistance in solving complex production, management, and environmental challenges.Program Needs Assessment:In spring 2014, I conducted a local needs assessment, distributing surveys to 788 farmers and agribusiness professionals in Oconto and Marinette Counties. One hundred thirty-nine usable surveys were returned (17 percent response rate). Respondents were asked to rate agricultural topics based on individual educational needs (Likert scale, 1=no need to 5=high need). Highest ranked animal health topics included: calf/heifer management (2.74), dairy modernization (2.68), milk quality (2.65), and dairy facilities (2.55). Top farm management educational needs were: farm succession (3.11), financial management (2.88), and use of technology (2.76). The survey results, in addition to my educational background and experience in veterinary medicine, were used to guide and prioritize my educational programming in Oconto and Marinette Counties.Current and Emerging Issues:   Economic Hardship in the Dairy IndustryDairy farms have encountered tight margins over the past few years with low milk prices, low commodity prices, and high input costs. The outlook for dairy farmers is not predicted to change as low milk prices are forecasted throughout 2019. Many factors are driving the market price of milk in the United States: large national dairy herd, declining domestic demand, reduced global exports with imposed tariffs, and a strong dollar. Some dairy farms within the last few years have struggled financially finding themselves a statistic in the market downturn. Farms will be faced either mandated via creditors or voluntarily selling their farm business(es) to meet their outstanding debts. According to the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, Wisconsin lost 691 farms in 2018, a calendar loss of 7.9%.Farms will continue to monitoring expenses tightly, but will also face emotional and mental stress due to the inability to pay monthly bills. Farm related suicides are double that of veteran suicides. Wisconsin farm families are seeking information to assist in discussing this topic in addition to ways to communicate family budget concerns with their children, and ways to take care of themselves.Farmers will also be exploring job opportunities off the farm to meet family expense needs. These individuals will be seeking opportunities to understand the private sector hiring, creation of resumes, and proper interview techniques. Individuals may be seeking alternative options to add income from their farm businesses such as a value-added product, or utilizing their current resources in other manners.  Dairy Replacements Dairy replacements, or young animals that will ultimately become lactating animals in the herd, are the foundation for genetic progress and improvement of the herd. Raising productive and successful dairy replacements is the second highest expenditure on Wisconsin dairy farms, behind feed costs, when all factors of milk production are considered (Hagedorn et al., 2013). It is estimated to cost $2,377 to raise a single replacement animal from birth to calving (Hagedorn et al., 2013). This cost can increase significantly if young animals are taxed with diarrheal diseases, which can reduce animal growth and productivity, require treatment, and/or lead to death. The USDA National Animal Health Monitoring System estimates 23.9 percent of pre-weaned heifers are treated for diarrheal diseases (NAHMS, 2007), with diarrhea cited as the leading cause of death of dairy heifers of all age groups (NAHMS, 2011).  Animal Well-Being Animal welfare concerns exist regarding painful procedures performed on young dairy animals. In January 2019, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) released an undercover video from a Marinette County heifer raiser on their practices of dehorning animals. This video is a vivid example of the need for continued education on the proper technique for pain mitigation in dehorning. Public perception of these procedures has resulted in greater scrutiny of all animal management practices. The average population is three-generations removed from an agrarian lifestyle.  Farm Succession/Transfer According to the 2012 Census of Agriculture, the average age of farmers in Oconto and Marinette Counties was 56.4 and 58.3 years of age, respectively. Currently, there are 129 and 66 dairy farms in Oconto and Marinette Counties, respectively. Across the country, the USDA estimates 70 percent of farmland will change hands in the next 20 years (National Institute of Food and Agriculture, 2017). Therefore, successfully transferring farms to the next generation will be a necessity to ensure the vitality of the agriculture industry. Farm succession is a complex, multi-faceted process, requiring consideration of a variety of topics such as profit margins, land value, farm size, and tax rates. Farm succession is often a laborious process, requiring strategic planning and open communication between all parties.  Alternative Dairy/Livestock: GoatWisconsin is known as ""America's Dairyland"". It is a widely accepted fact, Wisconsin is the leader in the dairy cow industry; however, Wisconsin is the leader in the nation of milk goat animals according to a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agriculture Statistics Survey on January 2016. From the January 2016 USDA report, Wisconsin has 44,000 head of milking goats. Most of the milk from these animals is used for making award-winning cheese which appeals to consumers across the nation. Dairy goat herds in northeast Wisconsin continue to grow both in number and size. Goat farmers are looking for educational resources from reliable sources.The Wisconsin dairy industry is a strong economic driver for the state. However, if current economic trajectories persist, farm profit margins will continue to tighten without strong educational interjections to improve production and financial efficiencies. As an educator with University of Wisconsin-Madison Division of Extension, I play a unique and key role to continued farm success by providing relevant, research-based information to decrease farm production costs, decrease costs associated with animal health, and streamline farm inputs, as evidenced by the impacts of my on-farm research, one-on-one farm consultations, and educational programming efforts. I will continue in developing both current and future educational program efforts in animal health and well-being and farm financial health and management to meet the needs of my clientele.My outreach educational programming will focus on the following emphasis areas: 1) animal health and well-being and 2) farm financial health and management. The scope of my educational work in animal health and well-being focuses on calf and heifer management, facilities management, milk and meat quality, and alternative dairy and livestock production.

115|Placemaking (2019)|"Situation StatementMy work plan is largely driven by community leaders and their priorities in Sauk County. I have developed a respected reputation throughout the region, and I am routinely invited to be engaged and help lead key community and economic development efforts. I have more requests for educational programming than I can provide so I select my work priorities based on my strengths, UWEX resources and potential impacts. Placemaking Sauk County is focused on supporting its unique communities in order to help them create and maintain places where people choose to live and work. The following situation statement is an excerpt from the 2017 ""Making Sauk: A Place Plan"":Change is the only constant. Places are continuously changing. Communities grow and evolve and natural events alter the characteristics of the landscape. Changes to infrastructure, technology, and the economy influence how decisions are made, and people involved in the process make choices that influence what a place looks like far into the future. Settlements that were started in 1940 in the Sauk Prairie area focused on wheat farming and raising hops, but quickly evolved with the influence of the railroad a mere 20 years later. As dairy and row crop production expanded, the landscape of Sauk County began to change into what it is today, ultimately influenced by the introduction of industry and tourism throughout the twentieth century. The landscape of Sauk County will continue to evolve; decisions made now will heavily influence what this place looks like far into the future. People, businesses, organizations and municipalities across Sauk County are actively engaged in conversations about the future of this amazing place. These conversations often focus on quality of life, sustainable growth, and the abundance of rich resources that this area has been blessed with. These resources include vast natural, agricultural, and cultural resources that distinguish Sauk County from the other 71 counties in the state. It also includes a strong community of hardworking people who focus their daily efforts on improving the communities around them. Sauk County has so much to offer, not only to its residents and the people who grew up here, but to the world. As the gateway to the Driftless region, Sauk County is unlike any other place, but it is difficult to gauge how many people recognize that. There is evidence that Sauk County needs be more progressive in its approach to attract and retain people: businesses have available jobs sitting empty; world-class organizations are experiencing declining numbers of patrons walking through their doors; and school districts have declining enrollments."|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
116|Mental Health 7 Well-Being (2019)|"Washburn county population demographics, as reported by the 2017 American Community Survey (ACS), indicate the following: 94.7% white; 1.6% Hispanic/Latino; 1.4% American Indian/Alaskan Native; 1.2% 2 or more races indicated; 0.6% Asian; 0.5% Black, with a total population count of 15,494. Our comprehensive poverty rate as obtained from the same data source is 12.8%. The 2010 US Census data reports that 20.3% of the population is >65 year old; 58.4% of the population is between the ages of 18-64; and 21.2% are <18 year old. There are 4 public school districts within the county and 1 private school. The public schools reported free & reduced lunch rates in 2017 ranging from 47.26% - 62.88%, according the WI DPI WISHDash online database.The WI Food Security project data from the 2011-15 report indicates that 16.8% of the population lives in the urban areas within the county; 20.71% of our children live in poverty; 22% of the population rents their home and of those renters 41.86% pay >30% of their income for rent. In addition this report notes that 6% of the eligible population does not own a vehicle; 30% of adults are obese and our county ranked 68th (out of 72) in the County Health rankings for health outcomes and 51st (out of 72)for health factors.According to the WI ACE's study with data from 2011-2015 - 20% of the residents of Washburn County have and ACE score of 4 or more; we have on average 61 hospitalizations from opioid use annually, 46% of the county are classified as ""asset limited, income constrained, employed (ALICE)"". According to the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps organization, a Robert Wood Foundation, ""these ALICE households often live paycheck to paycheck; have little or no savings; struggle to make ends meet and easily are bankrupted by a single medical bill"". In addition 31% of our children live in single parent households and according to the same organization ""adults and children in single-parent households are at risk for adverse health outcomes,"" including an increased likelihood of mental illness, substance abuse and depression. The ACS report also notes that we have 239 grandparents living with grandchildren under the age of 18 and of those 239, 117 are responsible for their grandchildren in Washburn county.All of the data above clearly paints the picture of the high level of stress faced by many of the families living in Washburn County. In addition to the data above the following information has been obtained from stakeholder conversations:There are limited parent education opportunities available for families - as shared by Health and Human Services, both the Head Start programs in the county, and the Family Resource Center.There are no programs to support individuals struggling with their finances to work towards greater independence - Washburn Christian Outreach & Indianhead Community Action Agency (ICAA).In contrast to other areas of the state we have a methamphetamine, marijuana, and alcohol epidemic which is impacting our jail population, schools, families, and is taxing all of our county resources. - County Jail Administration, Sheriff's Department, Health and Human Services, Spooner, Shell Lake, and Northwood School District.Mental Health resources are extremely limited and individuals requiring services often only seek them when in crisis - transportation issues compound the limited access - Washburn Co. Mental Health Task Force, Health and Human Services DirectorBased on the data and stakeholder conversations it is apparent there are two primary issues facing Washburn County: the need for parent, family and relationship based education as well as financial skills education across the lifespan. UW-Extension has a unique position in this county with broad reaching support for comprehensive programming to support the needs of the county residents. The vast amount of resources coupled with our extensive efforts to avoid duplication of services and our efforts to identify gaps in programming has established credibility and high levels of engagement with a wide variety of stakeholders and partners throughout the county. The remaining sections of this document will highlight the work that has been identified as key components in the larger picture of addressing the needs expressed in the data and conversations."|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0

119|Master Gardener Volunteer Training|The Master Gardener Program (MGP) was created in the early 1970's as a way for an extension educator to serve a broader audiences' need in obtaining answers to their gardening questions. The first records of MGP training in WI appear in the late 70's/early 80's. In Marinette County, the MGV training was first conducted in 1992 and has continued to be offered consistently since then. The program has trained residents of Marinette and Oconto Counties in Wisconsin and Menominee and Delta Counties of Michigan, most of which have become members of the Northern Lights Master Gardener Volunteer Association if they have continued on as active MGV's. Local MGV's conduct many educational workshops, assist in individual horticultural diagnostic services, and manage & plan most of the demonstration activities conducted within the Marinette County owned Harmony Arboretum Demonstration Gardens. Continued changes to duties of the Marinette County Agriculture/Horticulture Agent position and nearly full turnover of the leadership of the Northern Lights Master Gardener Volunteers' Association (NLMGA) in the last year have created both challenges and opportunities. The most significant challenge is forging new, clear communication channels; as well as creating clarity on the roles of UW-Extension staff and volunteers in the different aspects of continuing education for MGV's, NLMGA activities & guidance/oversight, and meeting the new or changing volunteer management needs of MGV's at the state-wide and local levels. To achieve success in this program, educators:Recruit and train volunteers to increase their capacity in addressing horticultural related issues on behalf of UWEX. Support volunteers and leverage their efforts via volunteer development principles, developing community partnerships, and creating/approving projects to assist UWEX address our educational priorities.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
120|Rusk County 4-H Volunteer Development|"Adult volunteers are Wisconsin 4-H's most valuable asset in delivering the quality youth-led, adult guided programs to support youth as they acquire essential life skills. Wisconsin 4-H Youth Development has over 9,650 volunteers who are enrolled as UW-Extension 4-H volunteers working with 30,000 youth enrolled in 4-H programs. In 2018, volunteers reported on average they donated over 58 hours per year. Approximately 72% of Wisconsin 4-H volunteers are female and 28% are male. Nationally, women continue to volunteer at a higher rate than men. (Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. Department of Labor.) In Wisconsin 4-H, approximately 97% of the volunteers are white. WI 4-H Youth Development volunteers currently do not reflect the demographics of most counties.In 2018, Rusk County had 55 adult volunteers. The demographics of volunteers were 51 % female and 49% male with approximately 100% of the volunteers being white. Rusk County demographics indicate there is a potential audience of volunteers who reflect 1.9% Native American and African American racial and ethnic group who are currently not volunteering in 4-H Youth Development.Volunteers play a critical role in the delivery of quality educational programs. In a survey completed January 2015, 4-H Youth Development staff identified Volunteer Development as an area in need of program support. Additionally, a WI 4-H Youth Development Survey was conducted in February 2014 of over 1500 volunteers. Adult volunteers in 4-H indicated relatively low awareness and understanding of some of the educational principles (Essential Elements and the Experiential Learning Process) that are central to the work of 4-H Youth Development. In the 2014 survey, volunteers expressed an interest in learning through not only face-to-face modalities; but also through online-learning such as webinars and podcasts.The 2017 Strategic Plan released by USDA NIFA and National 4-H Council outlines a 4-H Youth Development Vision for 2025. Nationally the following goal has been established ""Youth are surrounded with competent, prepared staff and volunteers."" This goal includes the following outcomes: ""The 4-H program is supported by a well-trained volunteer force."" ""4-H staff and volunteers engage in meaningful professional development.""In addition, there is a responsibility of volunteers to ensure access, equity and opportunity. The National 4-H Strategic goal states ""All youth engage in program and opportunities."" To that end it has been identified that ""4-H volunteers and staff are skilled, knowledgeable and prepared to work with all members of their community.""Rusk County is devoted to offering high quality positive youth development programming to the youth in Rusk County, these programs are offered with the support of the Rusk County 4-H volunteers. Historically, in the last 5 years, Rusk County has had limited critical leaders that have been volunteering for several years, fulfilling most of the volunteering roles and supporting new 4-H volunteers. The Rusk County 4-H program continues to recruit new skilled volunteers to offer learning experiences to Rusk County youth that were not offered as a leader lead projects in the past. With this historical knowledge and perspective of 4-H and a new eagerness for providing more high quality positive youth development learning experiences, Rusk County 4-H will need to provide more training opportunities/experiences to the volunteers."|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1

124|2019 Subsurface tile drainage monitoring project|UW Discovery Farms develops on-farm and related research to determine the economic and environmental effects of agricultural practices on a diverse group of Wisconsin farms. The Discovery Farms program is a farmer led program that focuses research on topics farmers feel are their biggest challenges. Project/research is directed by what is deemed priority issues by farmers. This process guides our research to address industry concerns. Discovery Farms meet with farmers and a steering committee to discuss the specific concerns and together determine how to move forward. Research projects are a team effort, and work within these projects is determined by location and the strengths of each of the Discovery Farms personnel.Understanding tile drainage water quality is a priority subject in the agriculture industry. It is important to understand tile drainage systems and how management practices in the fields affects water quality in tiles.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
125|Farm and Financial/Risk Management Education (2019)|Farm and financial/risk management skills are important for those farm owners/managers to improve upon regardless of their longevity in the agriculture industry. Volatility in agricultural commodity markets along with ever-changing input costs creates a need for farm owners/managers to manage their farm operation or business' profit margins. For example, crop farm owners/managers have seen lower commodity prices for the last three years and have requested programming related to marketing so that they can determine their cost of production and seek additional profit when market prices are above their breakeven price. In addition, the agricultural landscape in Dunn County continues to change and flexibility will be needed to address emerging farm management issues, such as land rent and budgeting for non-traditional farm enterprises. Farm owners/managers and agricultural service providers continue to request programs that focus on improving farm record-keeping skills as well as comparing the financial records with those of others in their industry. Also, with an aging farm operator population, more farm owners/managers are seeking information regarding farm succession planning and their next step in their farming career.Due to ongoing economic conditions in agriculture, many farms are facing significant financial challenges, resulting in questions regarding the viability of the businesses. Based on the Economic Research Service's latest farm income forecast, farm income has now been in general decline for the past four years and seems to be headed for a fifth in 2019. The downturn has clearly started to take a toll, financially and mentally for many farms, farm families and rural communities which depend on agriculture. Farms are experiencing challenges in their ability to successfully transfer the business to the next generation, and others will need to consider an exit strategy, and off-farm employment.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
126|Dairy Management and Production (2019)|Kewaunee and Door Counties have an informal specialization agreement involving the duties of both Agriculture Educators. This educator will be responsible for planning and implementing educational programs and services directly relating to Dairy and Livestock Management in the dual-county area.Kewaunee County's economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, mainly the dairy industry. Kewaunee County's 48,000 cows are expected to produce over 1.276 billion pounds of milk in 2018. Since this educator started with UW-Extension in 2007, the county herd average has increased from 28,000 to 49,000 cows. The county's herd total has decreased slowly over 12 years, however still has 130 herds averaging 356 cows, an increase of 235 cows per herd since 2007. Agriculture generates nearly $380 million of economic activity annually and provides over 21 percent of the eligible workforce with jobs in Kewaunee County.An initial needs assessment was done in Kewaunee and Door Counties in 2007. That needs assessment showed farm management (milk quality, herd health, reproduction), employee management, profitability, and modernization were top priorities for producers in both counties. Since 2007, formal and informal needed assessments have been sent via Qualtrics (email) and post card in 2010, 2013, and 2015. Results from follow-up needs assessments show producers continue to desire programming in the general farm management areas with additional emphasis on farm employee management. This small shift in programming needs is most likely due to the increase in herd size and more farms hiring employees to help with the day-to-day work. Those producers responding to livestock production requested programming on dairy beef production (dairy steers). The current trend with dairy steers is the shift to using beef sires on low-end dairy cows to produce a value-added by product of the dairy industry. The use of beef sires on dairy cows is more common due to the increased adoption of genomic testing in the herd.Kewaunee County hosted the 2017 Wisconsin Farm Technology Days show for the first time in the show's history. This educator initiated the application for Kewaunee County to host and is served as the Executive Secretary of the show.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
127|Upham Woods Program (2019)|"Overview of Upham Woods and Current TrajectoryBackground: Upham Woods Outdoor Learning Center is an informal science learning (ISL) center that is a part of the University of Wisconsin System, currently a part of the UW- Extension's Natural Resources Institute. Over the last four years, Upham Woods Outdoor Learning Center's increasingly vibrant outdoor classroom and dynamic statewide outreach program have strengthened the quality, diversity, and reach of environmental education in Wisconsin. Fast Facts:  Founded in 1941 318-acre facility- including a 200 acre state natural area Served 12,019 youth and adults in 2017 from 49 Wisconsin counties; served over 500,000 Wisconsinites since 1941 Programming includes:  on-site group visits from schools, 4-H programs, scouts, etc.  open enrollment summer camps open to youth statewideo outreach learning experiences across the state to school, scout, and 4-H groupsCurrent Trajectory Established by Renewed Outreach Efforts and Use of Technology 2014-2018:   Over $1.92 million in cumulative program revenue generated Over $1.01 million investment in capital projects in collaboration with UWEX administration Acquisition of over $1.45 million in extramural support grants for building environmental education capacity and expanding access to programs at Upham Woods as well as to statewide environmental education opportunities, including Digital Observation Technology Skills (DOTS):  Framework developed at Upham Woods and used statewide for integrating modern, mobile technology into outdoor, experiential science educationo 13,602 (and counting) youth and adults have used DOTS since 2014o Generates hands-on engagement with technology in the context of a classic outdoor learning settingo Digital tool kits are assembled, distributed and supported by Upham Woodso Resulted in 19 peer-reviewed articles authored or co-authored by Upham staff. Upham Woods programming reach has increased 28% in the last 4 years and revenue is up 15% in the same time period. Furthermore, our reach in 2017 was the largest in 32 years and our revenue is the highest in center history.Embracing Technology Rooted in Heritage of Upham WoodsWhen the University of Wisconsin received the donation of land that would become Upham Woods in 1941, Wakelin McNeel served as the Center's first superintendent. McNeel was also known as ""Ranger Mac"", a persona he created for a Wisconsin Public Radio show that he hosted. As part of his show, he invited youth and adults from across Wisconsin to explore, observe, engage, and conserve the state's wonderful natural resources. On the program, he often noted that ""If you didn't take a walk yesterday, you missed out on many things that may not come again"" (Matkin-Rawn 2004). Today, we share these same sentiments with our students, encouraging them to observe their surroundings and ask questions that enable them to better understand the world they inhabit. While Ranger Mac worked at Upham Woods in the 1940s and 1950s, many parallels exist between his service to the state and the direction Upham is headed today. Ranger Mac used the technology of the era radio to connect a statewide audience to the environment. By using a resource that was both pervasive and accessible, he drew youth and adults to issues in our natural world and encouraged them to explore Upham Woods. Today, we accomplish these same objectives through the Digital Observation Technology Skills (DOTS) program and web-based mobile resources. Ranger Mac's approach focused on observation and wonder in the outdoors. Today, we use terms such as informal science learning (ISL), inquiry-based instruction, project-based learning and place-based education to describe this same approach. Although there have been many changes in the last 76 years at Upham Woods, it continues to serve a crucial statewide presence in environmental education outreach by leveraging an effective blend of technology and youth development, within a context of vibrant natural resources and scenic beauty.Confidence in this Well-founded ApproachThe National Research Council's research shows that ISL is guided by student inquiry about the natural world, data collection related to their inquiry, and opportunities to present their findings to peers and community members (National Research Council, 2009). Further, the National Research Council states that informal learning environments are, in principle, accessible to all learners, and evidence suggests they have potential for supporting learners from non-dominant groups (National Research Council, 2009). In addition to providing experiential learning opportunities grounded in environmental concepts, ISL centers like Upham Woods expand the network of educators and facilitators engaged in environmental education and provide students with ""direct access to compelling phenomena in the natural world"" (National Science Foundation, 2011).While ISL centers, such as camps and nature centers, have historically had programming legacies rooted in the natural sciences, their educational practices can be in tension with the emphasis on the adoption of modern technology that often guides contemporary STEM education (Cuthbertson, Socha, & Potter, 2004). Yet using technology in outdoor education settings holds great promise in deepening scientific connections to local places through data collection. As an example, data collection within a context of location, community, and inquiry provides a place-based approach to education that contributes to active and engaged citizens (Hougham & Kerlin, 2016; Sobel, 2004). In modern science classrooms and careers, most scientific tools are digital. Consequently, adopting digital tools requires ISL centers to strike a careful balance between retaining the connection to place that outdoor, experiential learning promotes and serving youth and educators with modern STEM curricula. Connecting this further, place-based education like that promoted at Upham Woods has been shown to connect learners' STEM engagement to their experiences in informal settings, develop their acute observation skills, and increase their capacity to care about the environment around them (Land & Zimmerman, 2015; Greenwood & Hougham, 2015)."|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

129|2019 Monitoring water quality with local partners|UW Discovery Farms develops on-farm and related research to determine the economic and environmental effects of agricultural practices on a diverse group of Wisconsin farms. The Discovery Farms program is a farmer led program that focuses research on topics farmers feel are their biggest challenges. Project/research is directed by what is deemed priority issues by farmers. This process guides our research to address industry concerns. Discovery Farms meet with farmers and a steering committee to discuss the specific concerns and together determine how to move forward. Research projects are a team effort, and work within these projects is determined by location and the strengths of each of the Discovery Farms personnel.This year Discovery Farms is starting a water quality monitoring project with the new approach of using local partners. There are 6 monitoring sites 2 sites in each of 3 locations in Wisconsin. The new approach will used partners local to the research sites to assist with monitoring.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
130|Parent and Relationship Education|Strong relationships between parents and children can steer young people away from dangerous behaviors such as underage alcohol or drug use. A reduction in alcohol and drug abuse can save the county money relating to alcohol related treatment as well as incarceration. Programs are needed to enhance family relationships, parenting, child development and family well being. Many new parents do not have the knowledge or proper parenting education. According to the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute (http://www.countyhealthrankings.org), in 2018 the teen birth rate in Barron County was 23 out of 1,000, 30% of children were being raised in single parent homes. Access to parent education in Barron County is limited by barriers such as transportation and child care. Research indicates that children with an incarcerated parent have a 70% greater chance of going to jail themselves. This assures that taxpayers will be paying for the incarceration of a new generation of inmates for years to come. Incarceration costs approximately $25,000 per inmate annually according to Barron County Judge James Babler. The Barron County Jail Program Coordinator has indicated that she doesn't have the time, resources or expertise to provide the education necessary. No other department in Barron County Government has the staff time available and the research-based curriculum to provide this program. Without my involvement in this program the necessary education surrounding families would be lost. This too is an undeserved audience that can thrive from the opportunity to gain education.Another major way that children are affected is by parents' divorce when they are exposed to conflict between their parents. In fact, parental conflict affects children negatively regardless of whether their parents' divorce or not. These effects can be observed by researchers for years prior to the divorce taking place. Problems brought on by parental disagreements can appear in different ways  a drop in school performance, behavior problems at school, anxiety and depression.According to the most recent report Wisconsin Department of Health Services Report published in May 2015, 52% of all Wisconsin divorces in 2014 involved families with children under 18 years of age. Among divorces involving children, an average of 1.9 children were affected by each divorce. In 2014 Barron County granted 143 divorces; of those divorces 137 children were affected.Families perform a variety of key functions that contribute to both the mental and physical health of individuals as well as the public health and functioning of society. Throughout all developmental stages, from the prenatal period to the last years of life, strong healthy relationships help families effectively and efficiently raise healthy children, care for vulnerable members, and sustain productive workers and contributing community members. Children who are born into and raised in an environment of positive relationships have a strong foundation that can help them develop into healthy adults and productive citizens. This environment of relationships involves not only parents and children but also extended family and social networks, schools and childcare providers, and others who engage with the family. Stable, nurturing relationships have a powerful protective impact on children. They help prevent exposure to multiple risks and stressors, including family violence and neglect, parental incarceration, and mental illness. Exposure to these stressors is associated with numerous poor outcomes, some of which are commonly seen across multiple generations within families and are very costly to society. In addition to contributing to prevention, safe, stable, nurturing relationships with parents and other caregivers serve as a buffer to help mitigate the damaging impacts of toxic stress. Healthy relationships help children thrive. Adult health and well-being also depend in great part on the quality and success of relationships. Adults in stable relationships have better health outcomes, greater financial stability, a greater sense of well-being and improved capacity to provide care for vulnerable family members, including children and older adults. It has long been understood that a strong parent/child relationship is a key factor in preventing negative outcomes for children. More recent research suggests that strong relationships between parents and other adults, including romantic partners, friends and extended family, can help prevent child maltreatment and improve the capacity of adults to parent effectively. Healthy relationships help adults nurture.|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0
131|Farm Management Programming (2019)|"Washington County Agriculture & Dairy Industry: ""Agriculture works hard for Washington County every day. Family-owned farms, food processors and agriculture-related businesses generate thousands of jobs and millions of dollars of economic activity while contributing to local income and tax revenues. Washington County agriculture is diverse, which adds to its strength. Dairy leads the way, but grain, greenhouse and nursery, livestock, vegetable and farm-direct markets are also very important. Washington County's diverse agricultural atmosphere is a vital part of the area's culture, communities and economy. Residents find that this rural urban mix adds value to their quality of life. Employers find that it helps recruit high quality employees.Washington County agriculture provides 4,353 jobs, or about 7 percent, of the county's workforce of 66,760. Production jobs include farm owners and managers and farm employees. Agricultural service jobs include veterinarians, crop and livestock consultants, feed, fuel and other crop input suppliers, farm machinery dealers, barn builders and agricultural lenders, to name a few. Processing jobs include those employed in food processing and other value-added industries that support food processors. Every job in agriculture generates an additional 1.18 jobs in the county.Agriculture contributes about $435 million to county income Washington County agriculture accounts for $434.9 million, or 7 percent, of the county's total income. This includes wages, salaries, benefits and profits of farmers and workers in agriculture-related businesses. Every dollar of agricultural income generates an additional $0.85 of county income.Washington County agriculture generates $1.43 billion in economic activity, about 25 percent, of the county's total economic activity. Every dollar of sales from agricultural products generates an additional $0.41 of economic activity in other parts of the county's economy. Here's how agriculture stimulates economic activity:  The direct effect of agriculture equals $1.2 billion and includes the sale of farm products and value-added products.   Purchases of agricultural and food processing inputs, services and equipment add another $320.5 million in economic activity. For example, this includes business-to-business purchases of fuel, seed, fertilizer, feed and farm machinery, as well as veterinary services, crop and livestock consultants and equipment leasing.  This business-to-business activity then generates another $92.2 million in economic activity when people who work in agriculture-related businesses spend their earnings in the local economy.Economic activity associated with Washington County farms and agriculture related businesses generates $22.8 million in local and state taxes. This figure does not include all property taxes paid to support local schools. If it did, the number would increase dramatically.Dairy is a key Washington County industry. Dairy farming is the major agricultural industry in Washington County. On-farm production and milk sales account for $82.2 million. Processing milk into dairy products generates another $431.7 million.  Seven plants process dairy products in Washington County.  On-farm milk production accounts for 437 jobs, and dairy processing accounts for 1,012 jobs.  At the county level, each dairy cow generates $4,377 in on-farm sales to producers.  At the state level, each dairy cow generates about $34,000 in total sales.Source: S. Deller, 2014 Washington County Agriculture: Value & Economic ImpactOzaukee County Agriculture & Dairy Industry: Agriculture works hard for Ozaukee County every day. Family-owned farms, food processors and agriculture-related businesses generate thousands of jobs and millions of dollars of economic activity while contributing to local income and tax revenues. Ozaukee County agriculture features both traditional and large dairy operations along with a complement of grain and forage crops. In addition the horticultural, nursery, and direct marketing sectors continue to grow in size and economic impact.

Dairy farming is the major agricultural industry in Ozaukee County. On-farm production and milk sales account for $39.4 million. Processing milk into dairy products generates another $357.3 million.  Three plants process dairy products in Ozaukee County.  On-farm milk production accounts for 214 jobs, and dairy processing accounts for 544 jobs.  At the county level, each dairy cow generates $3,853 in on-farm sales to producers.  At the state level, each dairy cow generates over $34,000 in total sales.Source: S. Deller, 2014 Washington County Agriculture: Value & Economic ImpactCurrent & Emerging Issues: The agriculture industry is a very dynamic industry, with new technologies and practices being developed, managing income and expenses with an ever-changing markets, and an aging population.  Dairy farmers faced tight margins for the past couple years with 2019 milk prices predicted to raise slightly, but farm income is not expected to improve for the year. With a large national dairy herd, declining domestic demand, reduced exports due to large global outputs of milk, and a strong dollar, prices for commodities such as milk are negatively affected. Prices for other commodity crops such as corn and soybeans are also expected to remain low which, and farm income for grain producers is projected to go negative for 2019. Lower milk checks and grain prices mean reduced income for the farm to pay expenses related to the farm business, as well as living expenses. Farmers have to watch where they spend every dollar more carefully. With long-term low commodity prices, farmers and their families are emotionally and mentally affected through stress, and more farmers are considering exiting the industry or enterprise. When it comes to managing a farm business operation, production, herd health, animal well-being, and sound financial management can have a substantial impact on profitability. Based on the educational priorities identified in the needs assessment as well as current and emerging issues within the overall agriculture industry and community, this educator will conduct outreach for the 2019 programming year through two major program priorities: 1.) Farm Business Management and 2.) Animal Agriculture. Please see the following Plan of Work for details."|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
132|The Wisconsin Economy (2019)|Wisconsin is consistently listed as one of the least, if not the least entrepreneurial (Kauffman, Conroy and Deller 2016) and dynamic (Economic Innovation Group) states in the country. Further, the state has a strong manufacturing legacy and because of the pressures of globalization and technological advancement, this sector is losing employment power (Conroy 2018). These factors are directly related to economic performance of the state, including the slow jobs recovery and tepid wage growth. These factors are important to the quality of life of Wisconsin residents, particularly in rural areas which have been struggling more than urban areas.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
133|2019 Organizational/Capacity Build/Youth Leadership Development|ISSUE: Within the County there are 28 municipalities and six school districts. The County has 8% poverty rate and an 8% adult illiteracy rate. In recent memory there existed TEEN COURT within the county to address alternative means of dealing with youth offenders while building upon youth as leaders while positively transforming the community. The vast size of the county and lack of resources has had TEEN COURT operating in the past under 4-H on a limited budget. With the discontinuation of a 4-H Agent the Community Development Agent and Family Living Agent have taken on the program. School districts, municipal Judges, Police Chiefs, Sheriff Office and Circuit Court Judges along with health & Social Services staff have strongly expressed a need for this program (needs assessment 2018-2019) as teen delinquency, drug use, and other offenses have increased within the county of 38,000 people.INVOLVEMENT10%: UWEX is expertly equipped at providing the facilitated TEEN COURT, and has done so for the last six months with a longer history within the county and across the State.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
134|Parent and Relationship Education|Research is clear that strong family relationships significantly contribute to the health and well-being of individuals across the lifespan. Safe stable, nurturing relationships and environments have a powerful protective impact on children and are fundamental to healthy brain development. They help prevent exposure to multiple risks and stressors, including family violence and neglect, parental incarceration and mental illness. Children who are born and raised in an environment of positive relationships have a strong foundation that can help them develop into healthy adults and productive citizens. In addition, safe, stable, nurturing relationships with parents and other caregivers serve as a buffer to help mitigate the damaging impacts of toxic stress. Childhood exposure to toxic stress is associated with numerous poor outcomes, some of which are commonly seen across multiple generations within families and are very costly to society.In Ashland County, compromised social and economic factors contribute to toxic stress for families and children. According to County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHRR), in 2018 Ashland County ranked very low compared to other Wisconsin counties for Social and Economic Factors, at 59 out of 72. The factors used to determine this ranking include community safety, education, employment, family & social support, and income. Ashland County families are experiencing high poverty, with the latest figures from the US Census Bureau indicating that 15.% of residents live below the poverty line, compared to a Wisconsin average of 12.%. An alarming 22% of children under 18 living are living in poverty, as opposed to 16% of children statewide. Unemployment rates in Ashland County are 5.6%, above the state average of 4.1%. One-third of children in Ashland County live in single parent households.To address sources of toxic stress, Ashland County Human Development and Relationships programming will focus on education and community supports to strengthen families. These efforts are framed around the Center for Study of Social Policy's Strengthening Families Protective Factors, which have been shown to enhance child development and reduce the likelihood of child maltreatment. Building on these factors promotes the well-being of children, their families and their communities.|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0

137|Livestock Management and Production (2019)|Kewaunee and Door Counties have an informal specialization agreement involving the duties of both Agriculture Educators. This educator will be responsible for planning and implementing educational programs and services directly relating to Dairy and Livestock Management in the dual-county area.Kewaunee County's economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, mainly the dairy industry. Even though dairy is the main agriculture industry in Kewaunee County, there are an estimated 4,400 cow/calf (beef) pairs and market steers in the county. In addition to beef, there are an estimated 2,200 hogs sent to market from Kewaunee County annually. Agriculture generates nearly $380 million of economic activity annually and provides over 21 percent of the eligible workforce with jobs in Kewaunee County.An initial needs assessment was done in Kewaunee and Door Counties in 2007. That needs assessment showed farm management (milk quality, herd health, reproduction), employee management, profitability, and modernization were top priorities for producers in both counties. Since 2007, formal and informal needed assessments have been sent via Qualtrics (email) and post card in 2010, 2013, and 2015. Results from follow-up needs assessments show producers continue to desire programming in the general farm management areas with additional emphasis on farm employee management. This small shift in programming needs is most likely due to the increase in herd size and more farms hiring employees to help with the day-to-day work. Those producers responding to livestock production requested programming on dairy beef production (dairy steers). The current trend with dairy steers is the shift to using beef sires on low-end dairy cows to produce a value-added by product of the dairy industry. The use of beef sires on dairy cows is more common due to the increased adoption of genomic testing in the herd. Kewaunee County hosted the 2017 Wisconsin Farm Technology Days show for the first time in the show's history. This educator initiated the application for Kewaunee County to host and is served as the Executive Secretary of the show.|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
138|Community Conversations (2019)|Meetings with key stakeholder groups in 2018 identified the need for a series of facilitated community conversations around selected topics. Individuals representing human-service non-profits, local chambers, and local municipalities all identified the need for housing at a wide variety of price points, improved public transportation, and more workers across a broad range of industries. Members of each group offered a unique perspective on these three issues and have been working individually or within a topic-specific coalition. There is an interest in bringing the larger community together for focused conversations, but no structures exist for such conversations to occur. In addition, the Area 15 Situational Analysis identified the need for an in-depth, county-wide needs assessment. The Situational Analysis relied on existing research and the abbreviated timeline did not allow for meaningful stakeholder engagement. As part of rebuilding the Community Development program area after a two-year vacancy, a thorough and inclusive needs assessment is essential so that future programming focuses on the priority needs.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
139|Resilient Families and Communities |"At the local level, residents in Door County have reported feelings of isolation, social withdrawal, and lack of community support 1. Community members also state that geographic isolation is a barrier to access of support services and education. Likewise, the numbers of children partaking in free and reduced lunch continue to rise (28%) 3, access to quality childcare is referred to as a ""county crisis"" 1, and parents are also reporting high levels of stress as barriers to their own as well as their children's success 4. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, early childhood suspensions are continuing 5 and an increased need for social and emotional learning programs is present 4. ""Research shows that when families build strong relationships within supportive communities many sources of stress are reduced and outcomes for children, families and society improve."" -HDFR State Team One way, Extension programming can support these families is by utilizing the Protective Factors Framework, created by the Center for the Study of Social Policy. According to the National Alliance of Children's Trust and Prevention Funds, Protective Factors are ""Characteristics that make a parent, child, or family more likely to thrive and less likely to experience a negative outcome."" These include: social connections, knowledge of parenting and child development, concrete support in times of need, social and emotional competence of children, and parental resilience. Resiliency can be defined as having the ability to cope, accept, and grow amidst change and hardship. Those with a strong sense of resiliency (a skill that can be both nurtured and learned), may be better positioned to address adversity when it arrives 6. In rural Door County, the need for resiliency is matched by the high numbers of adverse childhood experiences reported by residents, as 15-20% report 4+ adverse childhood experiences 7 (ACEs). ACEs matter in terms of health and well-being, as higher ACE incidents (4+) correlate with a greater likelihood of experiencing impaired childhood brain development, risky lifestyle behaviors (drug and alcohol misuse, unhealthy relationships, etc.), as well as liver disease, cancer, and/or diabetes 8. While ACEs have lasting health impacts for both adults and children, Harvard's Center for the Developing Child (2016) states, ""the single most common factor for children who develop resilience is at least one stable and committed relationship with a supportive parent, caregiver, or other adult"" for it is within these relationships, children learn the essential life skills of behavior/emotion regulation, empathy, problem-solving, and connection. Still, it is important to remember that each child works in synergy with his/her surroundings and relationships; it is both a child's biology and environment that can support or halt resiliency development 6. Therefore, healthy resiliency may be threatened if an individual's surroundings do not cultivate attitudes, cultures, and beliefs that nurture its development and support trauma-informed care practices. Thus, coalitions and programs that support Door County families may be of essential need. By working together to increase the community's capacity for change, communication may increase, redundancies may be reduced, and awareness may arise. Likewise, research-based programs that support and empower caregivers, reduce stress, and strengthen problem-solving skills may change household dynamics leading to stronger family relationships. Also, finding creative ways to counter issues of isolation and social withdrawal, may also greatly benefit all age groups, as social support has been found to increase resiliency as well as overall well-being. 1.

142|Local Government Education and Support |Successful local governments routinely undergo processes to help its communities understand future trends, prepare and adapt to new circumstances, enhance quality of life and economic development opportunities, operate efficiently, and better serve their constituents. These deliberative efforts can lead to more resiliency within the local system, which is compulsory to respond to transitions in the economy, workforce, energy sources, the environment, and societal needs and desires. The development of strategic plans are tools that should define the future aspirations and the steps needed to achieve them. Strategic planning involves deliberative processes by an organization's representatives and often, external stakeholders. In addition to providing direction, with meaningful conversations, the act of planning spurs creativity and can help to strengthen the cohesion within an organization.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
143|Financial Capability (2019)|"According to The National Endowment of Financial Education, Latinos have the highest labor participation, lowest retirement security, and have a longer life expectancy than any other demographic in the nation.[1] Moreover, the U.S. is home to 52 million Latinos and the number is projected to grow to 133 million by 2050 and represent 30% of the U.S. population. Moreover, in many Latino-immigrant families, Latinas are expected to be income contributors and are the managers of household finances. They are also more likely than Latino men to liquidate pensions and savings when changing jobs or facing an emergency.In Wisconsin, specifically, according to the US Census, Latinos are now the largest minority group with the largest increases since 2000 occurring in Milwaukee County, Dane County, and Brown County. The latest ""Latinos in Wisconsin: A Statistical Overview"" reports that[2]:Median household and family incomes in 2010 were vastly less for Latinos than for the total population (72% and 59% of the total populations' medians, respectively).34% of Latino households earned less than $25,000 in 12 months prior to 2010 compared with 25% of total population households.The gender gap in earnings between male and female Latinos was smaller than in the total Wisconsin population the time of the 2010 ACS The earnings gap between Latino and total population males was over $14,000. Between Latinas and total population females, the earning gap is over $8,000.2010 ACS measures suggest that more than one fourth of the Latino population lived in poverty. The combination of lower earnings and larger family size contributed to a greater risk of poverty for Latinos.The 2010 Latino men and women had rates of unemployment that were roughly one-and-a-half times those of their counterparts in the total Wisconsin population.The population increase tied with these findings, and interest expressed from Latino community organizations demonstrate that there is a definite need for financial literacy programming within the Latino communities. Equally importantly, as the study ""Latinas: Hungry for Financial Education, Challenged by Cultural Stereotypes,"" Latinas and Latino households are hungry for financial education and recognize the need to improve their financial stability.[1] Golden, Paul.

144|Parent and Relationship Education|"Families perform a variety of key functions that contribute to both the mental and physical health of individuals as well as the public health and functioning of society. Throughout all developmental stages, from the prenatal period to the last years of life, strong healthy relationships help families effectively and efficiently raise healthy children, care for vulnerable members, and sustain productive workers and contributing community members.Children who are born into and raised in an environment of positive relationships have a strong foundation that can help them develop into healthy adults and productive citizens. This environment of relationships involves not only parents and children but also extended family and social networks, schools and childcare providers, and others who engage with the family. Stable, nurturing relationships have a powerful protective impact on children. They help prevent exposure to multiple risks and stressors, including family violence and neglect, parental incarceration, and mental illness. Exposure to these stressors is associated with numerous poor outcomes, some of which are commonly seen across multiple generations within families and are very costly to society. In addition to contributing to prevention, safe, stable, nurturing relationships with parents and other caregivers serve as a buffer to help mitigate the damaging impacts of toxic stress. Healthy relationships help children thrive. The Family Living Educator works closely with family serving agencies in the county to identify community needs that impact the well-being of families. The educational role of the Family Living Educator includes identifying the best use of existing resources and working collaboratively with these agencies to achieve intended outcomes by feasible target dates. The Family Living Educator also links the family organizations to UW-Extension expertise by using the concepts of evidence-based resources and strategies. The Family Living Educator's evaluation guidance and development promotes the importance of accurate data collection for a specific project as well as the future direction of the program.Today's parents can benefit from technology to support their parenting. Married couples with children who are younger than age 18 have higher rates of internet and cell phone usage, computer ownership, and broadband adoption than any other households (Kennedy, Smith, Wells, & Wellman, 2008). Usage of social networking, e-readership, video chat, tablets, and smartphones for parenting purposes is increasing at an astonishing pace as well (Pew Internet & American Life Project, 2011). Access to digital devices and the Internet is no longer limited to middle class families; the clear majority of parents, including those from low-income and vulnerable populations, are now connected.Available web-based knowledge and programs can both stand-alone and supplement face-to-face programs. Increasingly, the web has become the initial point of contact where parents seek out and access information. It also functions as the ""front door"" through which parents learn about and connect to local and county resources, including face-to-face education and assistance. Having a prominent online presence is critical to successfully reaching and educating parents in the 21st century. As participants in the 2017 pilot of eParenting Little Ones, the Head Start coordinator, school district 4K coordinator and one child care center director all felt that the program was easy to use, information was accurate, interesting and appropriate for the parents."|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0
145|Natural Resources and Community Development|The population of Dane County in July of 2017 was 536,416 and is currently the fastest growing county in the state. A key way to help ensure healthy communities in Dane County is to ensure that the local non-profits are vibrant and able to work at their mission to the best of their ability. Dane County has over 4000 non-profits including many that serve the entire state of Wisconsin. This educator invests time in assisting organizations build their capacity to do their work. Organizational capacity building also extends to government agencies too. Being the county that has the capital city, many governmental bodies reside here. Dane County UW Extension is well suited to assist local organization's build their capacities, plan for the future so that they are strategically positioned and ready for change, and strengthen their leadership. As an Extension faculty member who has been trained in systems thinking and analysis, conflict, communication, facilitation, change processes, leadership, and organizational development make me well positioned to assist Dane County's organizations and local governments to help ensure community vitality. As a natural resources educator I will focus most of my work with either local governments or environmental organizations.The rapid county growth also brings additional stresses to the county's water and land resources. The Situation Analysis completed after a review of current plans and interviews or focus groups for Dane County in 2018 identified protection of natural resources, climate change, and working to maintain ground and surface water quality as 3 of the 14 high priority issues for the county. Groundwater provides all the water for domestic and industrial water use and recharges locally. Water quality is a problem as 25-35% of the county's approximate 23,000 private wells have nitrate-nitrogen levels that exceed the state and federal standards for safe drinking water and pesticides have also been found in well water and chloride levels have been rising in municipal wells due to winter salt use. Runoff pollution in urban, rural and transitional areas also threatens the county's surface water. The majority of the streams and 37 lakes are eutrophic or overly nutrient rich. Storm water increases in both quantity and water quality problems as impermeable surfaces grow with development. Storm water runoff causes significant problems to the county's surface water resources. Along with this is the need to protect shore lands and open spaces as the pressures of growth emerge. The county also has developed a Pollinator Protection plan as pollinators have been in decline throughout the state, nation and world. The county is actively trying to encourage pollinator habitat protection and creation. The Federally endangered Rusty patch Bumblebee has been found at various locations in Dane County. This has put even more emphasis on protection of our local pollinators.There is an ever increasing need for local governments and all citizens to become active stewards in protecting our natural resources. Dane County's natural environment - its forests, soils, water, wildlife, and scenic beauty provide a significant contribution to our quality of life. It supports agriculture, forestry, tourism, surface mining and many other industries. It provides recreational opportunities, waste disposal sites and the place we call home.Many current Dane County plans have identified protecting our environment as one of the top three concerns in Dane County. The County Executive and the County Board both have initiatives focused on conserving and protecting our land, water and other natural resources.In collaborative efforts with other natural resource agencies, this Extension Natural Resource educator will help plan and implement programs and projects that address these local natural resource issues and enhance local stewardship of the natural environment. Efforts will be made to help local community leaders and citizens including youth to learn how to increase their understanding of the environment and enhance their ability to be good stewards of the natural environment.Finally 20% of my time is currently bought out by the Dane County Environmental Council as staff for the Council to oversee their work. As much as I can I try to integrate educational work of the Council with my Extension work such as my pollinator protection work. I also leave about 30-40 % of my time unplanned so that I can be nimble and responsive to the quickly changing needs of the county. This has enabled me to have the time available to be part of important emerging issues and assist with county task forces and other projects that rapidly arise in Dane County.|0|1|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

149|Advancing Horticulture Education (2019)|In the previous year an agriculture needs assessment survey was conducted and analyzed. It was very helpful in assisting me with what the needs were for my agriculture producers that I created a horticulture needs assessment. Since the assessment was not created until later in 2018 I plan to continue that survey through out this year (2019). Analyzing the data I did collect has indicated that the top five programming they would be interested in was the Master Gardener Level 1 and Level 2 training, pruning, pest and disease management, sustainable horticulture, and environmental protection. This may change as the needs assessment is conducted further but for this year my focus will be on advancing horticulture education through the Master Gardener program and interested horticulture groups.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
150|Dairy Programming|Dairy is the largest agricultural sector in Wood County, accounting for 60-70% of total on-farm agricultural receipts. In addition there are large sectors of the area economy that rely on the dairy industry including dairy processing, dairy equipment, forage and crop equipment, lending, accounting, insurance, health care and many other direct and support industries. The dairy industry is currently in financial distress with record numbers of dairy producers exiting the industry after four years of below average prices. The industry is consolidating with fewer and larger farms, but regardless of size, profitability has been difficult to establish.Dairy producers are considering new technologies and seeking efficiencies wherever possible to improve their enterprise. The situation is very similar across Central Wisconsin where I partner with other Extension Educators to support the dairy production system.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
151|Community Leadership Development|Almost 20 years ago, a task force of Extension agents, local university educators, directors from area chambers of commerce, and other local organizations, associations and agencies, identified a lack of leaders in Southwest Wisconsin and by enhancing the number of engaged leaders in our communities, they will be better able to address the declining numbers of volunteers serving on and leading committees, boards, planning teams and work groups in the community. The task force members recognized that a formal leadership development program was needed to build the knowledge and skills, motivation and confidence, and capacity of the citizens of the region to serve as change agents and leaders, to ensure the health and vitality of the region's communities. After researching other leadership programs, the Task Force decided that a collaborative effort, rather than a single community-based program would make it more sustainable - drawing on resources and participants from a larger geographic area.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
152|Addressing substance abuse prevention (2019)|"A. Marquette County, WIData indicate, and key leaders affirm, that preventing substance abuse remains a high priority in Marquette County. Pregnant women smoking is nearly twice that of the state average; cancers, especially lung, are uncommonly high in Marquette County. The 2017-2022 Marquette County Health Assessment lists alcohol, tobacco and other substance abuse in its top three priorities.[1] Substance abuse and unhealthy lifestyle choices are rooted in family practices, community norms, and societal influences. Tackling entrenched high-risk behaviors requires decades of focused, collaborative action grounded in the evidence of ""what works,"" which includes using a combination of practices, programs and environmental change. Although there is still much more to achieve, efforts to reduce and prevent youth substance abuse over the past fifteen years in Marquette County are paying off: youth alcohol use and tobacco smoking were reduced by half since 2003.[2] High school students have significantly decreased heavy drinking. However, high school students increased frequent marijuana and e-cigarettes use, and driving under the influence of alcohol. Adult heavy and binge drinking has decreased, defying state and national trends over the past 10 years.[3] Marquette County's substance abuse prevention coalition is Healthy Communities Healthy Youth (HCHY). HCHY uses multiple data-driven, evidence-based strategies, and multi-sector members participate in regional, statewide, and national professional development. UW-Extension and Health Department provide core leadership for HCHY to prevent substance abuse and promote healthy lifestyle choices. Allen is a certified Wisconsin Substance Abuse Prevention Specialist.B. Opioid Crisis Work GroupWisconsin's opioid crisis includes 916 deaths in 2017 from opioid overdose - more than those who die in car crashes. Overdoses of prescription painkillers by people ages 10-14 have increased dramatically in recent years - by over 200%. Extension educators can and are contributing to the prevention of opioid abuse and overdose in Wisconsin, and can learn more about their roles and resources in 2019.[1] Marquette County Community Health Improvement Plan 2017-2022, Marquette County Health Department. http://www.co.marquette.wi.us/home/showdocument?id=9819 [2] Marquette County 2015-16 Youth Risk Behavior Survey Report, Westfield and Montello School Districts.[3] Healthy Communities Healthy Youth coalition, 2003-2016 Report to the Community."|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0
153|Pop-Up-Produce Garden Kits for Low-Income Families (2019)|Marathon County has an estimated population of 135,732. The Marathon County Jail was reported to be 70% over capacity with most of those convicted due to drugs or drug related activities. Currently, occupant overage is vetted to other counties, which is an expensive practice. The impact on families of those incarcerated is devastating. Youth are sometimes placed in foster care or shelter homes. The extreme amount of stress associated with this for Marathon County families is immeasurable. Marathon County strives to be the healthiest, safest, and most prosperous county in the State. To this end, collaboration among community leaders, our elected County Board of Supervisors, and Marathon County employees has led to development of a 2018-2022 Strategic Plan, identifying area of focus in the coming years (http://www.co.marathon.wi.us/Portals/0/Departments/CAD/Documents/StrategicPlan_2018-2022.pdf).As a UW-Extension Horticulture Educator, my unique contribution to addressing Marathon County's Strategic Plan, thus far, has been to identify target populations where therapeutic horticulture could improve well-being. After lengthy review of the 2018-2022 plan, there are three populations on which I have been focusing my efforts: 1) jail inmates, 2) county youth, and 3) individuals in addiction recovery or those living with mental illness. For 2019, my plan of work centers mainly upon county jail inmates and community youth, although there is some overlap here with individuals in addiction recovery or those living with mental illness. Based on numerous studies conducted across the globe, it is likely that therapeutic gardens and horticulture programs will positively impact the physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual well-being of individuals in these target populations (American Horticulture Therapy Association, 2018).Upon my hiring, I reached out to stakeholders across Marathon County, and specifically within the City of Wausau where our county jail is located. I provided a series of four public informational sessions to raise awareness of therapeutic horticulture as a viable treatment option for individuals across diverse populations and added two additional programs to more specifically inform Master Gardener Volunteers in Marathon and Portage Counties of our community engagement efforts. Approaches in therapeutic horticulture vary by population and programming provided in 2019 will be research-based. I continue to be told that even if we reach only ONE person through this initiative, we will have made a difference! By not engaging in this situation, UW-Extension will fail to do its part in supporting positive mental and physical health for youth and adults in Marathon County.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
154|Family Financial Capability |The poverty numbers within Chippewa County are in line with the current need for financial supports throughout the state. The statistics within the 2015 FINRA Financial Capability Survey suggests an ongoing financial insecurity in Wisconsin, signaling the need for supportive educational programming (Family Financial Security Team Plan of Work, 2016). In Chippewa County, poverty, trauma, substance abuse, and isolation reach many families. The poverty rate in Chippewa County is 11.3%, with the food insecurity rate at 14.3% (Clark, Johnson, Malual, Walsh, Tarter, & Fastner, 2016). According to the ALICE (Asset Limited Income Constrained Employed) report, 42% of families in Chippewa County make under the amount needed to afford their basic needs. Based on this 2014 point in time data, the ALICE report shows that the towns of Chippewa Falls, Stanley, and Cadott contain the highest count of families struggling in Chippewa County (Alice in Chippewa County, 2017). This data suggests a need for programming in financial education, capability, and stability. Too many individuals experience financial crisis due to lack of income, inadequate savings, too much debt, and making non-informed spending choices. Education is needed to help families make better financial choices with the monies they have. Education can help families meet their future needs by addressing the basics of earning, spending, saving, investing, and housing. It is surmised that when families utilize financial education, they will learn how to improve the management of their money (Family Financial Security Team Plan of Work, 2015).References2017 Chippewa County Community Health Survey, (2018).2017 Chippewa County Youth Survey, (2018).ALICE by County - United Way of Wisconsin.

155|High Quality Membership Programs (2019)|"Research shows that high quality programs are more likely to foster positive youth developmental outcomes. High quality programs are characterized by 4 key elements: (1) safe, inclusive, and welcoming environment, (2) supportive and caring adults, (3) content that simultaneously challenges and sparks passion and interest, and (4) high levels of youth voice in program decision making. Together, these elements promote youth engagement, and in turn, the developmental and practical skills for youth to succeed. Regardless of the type of program (in-school, after-school, on-going, or sporadic), programs that focus on maximizing each of the high quality elements are more likely to be engaging for participants.These key elements are especially important for 4-H and Extension-based Positive Youth Development programs because each element is within the control of program educators and participants. The elements can change and improve over time. By monitoring and evaluating each of the key elements, program leaders can adapt and improve the program to maximize positive youth development outcomes for all participants. Research with 4-H members nationally has shown that programs that implement these elements contribute to positive developmental outcomes including: 1) academic motivation and success, 2) social competence, 3) personal standards, 4) contributions to others, 5) connections to others, and 6) personal responsibility. In turn, these developmental outcomes in the longer term contribute to increased academic and vocational success, civic engagement, economic stability, and overall wellbeing.https://health.oregonstate.edu/sites/health.oregonstate.edu/files/thriving-model/pdf/2018-thriving-model-summary-booklet.pdf 4-H programming in Chippewa County currently centers around caring adult volunteers and the programs the adults in our program feel the youth need. The creation of new 4-H programming stalled over the last few years through burn out of volunteers, volunteers suffering from founder's syndrome and changeover in staff. The last new event/program created came in 2016 with a 5-8 grade educational experience. Chippewa County 4-H according to the Leader's Council Executive Board survey has become a place where we check things off a list that the event is done, rather than consistently ""making the best, better."" A term coined for this county is ""4-H blindness."" This means that volunteers believe our program is the best, yet lack the 4-H worldview that there are other neat programs offered in neighboring counties or states. Our youth do see this as they attend State Fair, Fall Forum, and the other great educational opportunities offered by WI 4-H. Through high quality programming, provided by youth leadership, the face of Chippewa County would shift from people who perceive themselves as the experts on youth to the youth who are experts on what they/their peers need."|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1
156|Profitable Livestock and Dairy Production|Between 1990 and 2007 Census of Ag, (2018 Census of Ag is being completed) farm numbers increased in Iowa County, driven largely by farms being split into smaller retirement and weekend farms by urban development pressure from Madison and Dubuque, Iowa. The farms in the middle are disappearing, some getting larger, others selling the farm at retirement into smaller units. Grant, Iowa and Lafayette Counties rank 1, 2, and 3 respectively in Wisconsin for beef production. Grant County is also ranked 1 for swine. Although National Ag Statistics Service no longer keeps county level data, the last year this information was available (2000), 25% of the sheep population was also located in the 5 southwestern counties. Dairy and meat goat operations are concentrated within the southwest region, and recently dairy sheep operations are increasing. While cow dairy is still a significant part of the agriculture landscape, age of operator and economics are resulting in fewer farms milking more dairy cows, or small dairy enterprises transitioning to grazing and/or organic management. Since beginning in the role of Ag educator in 2009, 100 dairy (30%) have ceased operating in Iowa County. The transition to non-dairy livestock will likely continue.Livestock production is a significant part of the local ag economy, producers purchase inputs, hire veterinarians, trucking and other services. Ruminant livestock require forage, the cost of which, until recently, was being pulled higher by increases in the grain market. Currently being pulled higher still by 2nd lowest supply in 70 years. The loss of pasture and hay ground to grain may have stabilized with the decrease in grain prices, most of this converted land should not be in row crop production. The forecasts are for improved profit potential for livestock over the next several years and consumer demand for artisan dairy, goat and sheep milk cheeses continues to outpace production, even in the current year of excessive dairy production. Farms and farmers have a resource base. Farms may have vacant facilities that can be converted to livestock from dairy. They often have a forage base in hay acres and harvest equipment as well has acres that are most suitable to grazing. Farmers themselves possess knowledge and husbandry skills that can be transferred to other species such as beef, sheep or goats. Success in livestock comes down to managing costs, primarily feed but also in labor efficiency. Some producers will adapt strategies which lower their cost of production, they may have the scale to invest in technologies which improve feed and/or labor costs. Smaller producers (livestock and dairy)may need to consider alternative products and markets, including grass based, organic, and tapping into regional food systems. Iowa County in Southwest Wisconsin sits within a circle of some 75 million consumers within a 5 hour drive. There are ag products and services which we can offer this group of people. There may be alternative ag enterprises with higher profit margins that require smaller acreages that can fit into a local or regional food system. A study by the Center for Integrated Ag System at UW-Madison highlighted the lack of federally inspected processing facilities needed to access large population markets outside of Wisconsin.|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
157|Building Strong Resilient Families|"Winnebago county is comprised of suburban, urban, and rural areas. According to the 2015 U.S Census data, Winnebago County has a population of 169.546 residents. Winnebago County is comprised of a mix of cities (5), towns (16), villages (2) and unincorporated communities (8). Winnebago county is largely populated by white/non-Hispanic individuals (92.7%). Of note, however, between 2010 and 2015 other racial and ethnic groups represented the largest growth in population changes in our area. For example Black/African American representation grew from 1.8% to 2.1% (14.3% increase) and our Asian, Hispanic/Latino and American Indian populations continue to grow at rates of more than 10%. This changing landscape of people creates a strong pull to continue to be responsive, respectful seekers of cultural competence and connection.Winnebago County residents report a median household income of $52,018 with 12.0% of residents living in poverty. This is a 12.5% increase from 2015-2015. Living in poverty has major impacts on one's overall well-being. While reviewing the data and scanning the environment major themes have emerged in response the the challenges that our families face.Challenges Facing Winnebago County Families:Disconnection: Research shows that ""when families build strong relationships within supportive communities stress is reduced and outcomes for children, families, and society improve"" (HDFR Impact Report). The national Research Council also reports that more than 50% of premature deaths are attributable to non-medical factors such as where one lives. Strengthening connections between people increases their hope, sense of belonging and resilience to adversity. People who have strong connections to each other are more likely to seek help before a crisis occurs. Research also indicates that parents who have strong social connections are less likely to abuse/neglect their children (Child Welfare Information Gateway). Parenting is a difficult task, and if attempted without the buffer of supportive relationships both the parent and child will suffer undue stress. We know that there are many barriers to connection (lack of awareness, poorly developed social-emotional skills, poverty, poor mental health and transportation) with support and encouragement we can work together as a community to build stable networks of families who support each other physically, emotionally, spiritually and economically.Poverty/HousingIn Winnebago county 16% of household live below the poverty line. According to the Annie E. Casey foundation (2015) on average families need an income of roughly twice the official line to cover the entire cost of basic expenses of a household; this represents food, shelter, clothing, health care, food and child care. "" Poverty has a profound negative impact on a children's development, academic success, health, safety, and life achievement"" (State of the Fox Valley Child Report)Out of Home Living Placement for Children:In Winnebago County approximately 6% of children live with someone other than their parents (2325 total children) according to the 2010 census data. For grandparents in particular, this presents a multitude of parenting challenges. Aging, lack of connection to parenting-peers, financial challenges and the grieving process are all present with these families. Children who are also raised by non-biological parents require additional supportive strategies to ensure healthy trajectories into adulthood. Trauma and Adversity in Childhood:The brain is wired to thrive in the environment that it is constructed. When a brain is wired to adapt and respond to repeated stressors or traumatic experiences, it shapes the way that a person responds and adapts to the world. These behaviors, while critical for survival in highly stressful environments can be maladaptive in every day interactions. When we understand that individuals who have been exposed to trauma and stress are responding in the way that feels safe for them, we are able to take a more compassionate approach to their experiences with us. By recognizing these responses as ones that may be a product of stress we can create healthy, safe, predictable environments that allow for individuals to become empowered. As their self-efficacy increases, their brain begins to form new pathways and adaptive behaviors supporting their growth and healthy choices. More than 20% of Winnebago residents report having experienced more than 4 experiences in their childhood that are considered adverse. This study, is not comprehensive to include other toxic experiences such as poverty or neighborhood violence (short sample). We know that trauma is pervasive. We cannot tell by just looking at someone if they have a trauma history or if they have or are experiencing toxic stress do it is critical to work as a coordinated community to increase awareness and create a compassionate response that allows for individuals to live their best lives.Mental Health Concerns:According to the 2016 Youth Risk Behavior Survey 19.4% of Winnebago County high school students reported seriously considering attempting suicide (WI average 13.2%). Additionally, more than 20% of Winnebago county residents have more than 4 or more ACEs (Wisconsin Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention Board). these traumas in childhood are likely to create lasting negative outcomes in all domains of wellness. According to the County Health Rankings Report; adults report an average of 3.4 poor mental health days per month."|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0
158|Youth STEM Education (2019)|When considering the importance of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, many reports speak of job opportunities and economic drivers in a global environment. Research strongly suggests that STEM educational initiatives are not just creating scientists and engineers, but producing STEM literate persons in all areas of the workforce. Eighty percent of the fastest growing occupations in the U.S. require STEM adequacy, and science and technology jobs are projected to grow by 20.6 percent through 2020, more than doubling the 10.1 percent overall U.S. labor force's projected growth (Beatty, National Research Council Committee on Highly Successful Schools or Programs for K-12 STEM Education, National Research Council Board on Science Education, & National Research Council Center for Education, 2011). Additionally, in middle-skill jobs (jobs that require more than a high school diploma, but less than a four year degree), over 67% of openings require, at a minimum, proficiency in productivity software such as Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word and typically other digital literacy skills (Burning Glass Technologies, Captial One, 2015). Overall, it seems clear that middle-skills work has shifted decisively and is now digitally intensive.As a mission mandate, the impacts of STEM educational programming within 4-H have been investigated. Hershberg et al. found that youth in 4-H science programs were nearly two times more likely to participate in science, engineering and computer technology programs during OST (Grades 10 - 12). Additionally, girls who participate in 4-H are two times more likely (Grade 10) and nearly three times more likely (Grade 12) to take part in science programs compared to girls in other OST activities (Hershberg, DeSouza, Warren, Lerner, & Lerner, 2014). Other researchers state that STEM education within 4-H can improve science literacy (Smith, Heck, & Worker, 2012) and build problem solving skills (Daniels et al., 2013).Trempealeau County is a rural area with a rapidly growing Latino population in western Wisconsin. In 2000, the Latino population made up less than 1% of the total population. By 2010 the Latino population had risen to 5.8 percent of the population (Applied Population Lab, 2014). This has had a dramatic impact on the makeup of school populations with some districts having a Latino population of 41% of their entire student population. Trempealeau County is also relatively poor with most districts reporting a population that is between 40-50% economically disadvantaged with the highest being 55.7% (DPI school report cards 2013-2014). This unique population is regularly underrepresented when it comes to STEM education with only 2.2% of Latinos having earned a first university degree in the natural sciences or engineering by age 24 (ref fed strategic plan)On a local level our counties businesses, schools, and libraries have all recognized an education in the sciences as valuable to both individuals and communities and are looking for programs that can meet their needs in this area. According to the DPI school report cards 6 out of 7 school districts in Trempealeau County fell below the Wisconsin average in either mathematics achievement or mathematics growth, scores are much lower for Latino students. Female students are also marginalized with overall lower test scores on the county level in mathematics. This is another population that is underrepresented in the STEM fields. Women make up the majority of all college students and 46 percent of the American workforce but represent less than one fifth of all bachelor degree recipients in the areas of computer science and engineering and hold less than a quarter of all STEM jobs (ref fed strategic plan). These test scores and national trends indicate a clear issue that needs to be addressed.Two school districts in the county have established 21st Century Learning Centers as a means to meet the growing demand for quality afterschool programming that uses STEM education as a foundation. These centers are regularly searching for programming that can meet the needs of their students and the UW-Extension has shown itself as a valuable partner. Interviews with local librarians have indicated the strong desire to integrate STEM literacy into their programming as a core need of the people they serve. It is through these local agencies, who have also identified the need and are ready and willing for help, that we can work in partnership to extend the reach of 4-H science and UW-Extension programming and ensure effective and impactful STEM education programs.Evaluations from previous STEM programs implemented in Trempealeau County indicate that these programs fill a need for science curriculum in elementary education and have been both effective and popular. Surveys taken from afterschool and summer camps indicate that students who complete the program have a much higher interest in science and engineering, have gained foundational STEM comprehension, and developed problem solving and critical thinking skills. Of all total respondents 93% stated they would encourage their child to participate in another UW-Extension science camp and 86% stated they were 'very likely' to recommend Extension science programs to other families.The need for STEM education is critical to the success of the young people in Trempealeau County and across the country. The diverse and unique population of Trempealeau County shows a clear need for supplemental STEM education to meet the needs of all students. Educators, organizations, businesses, and communities have made it clear that they see the need for STEM education. If these needs are not met our young people will graduate from school unprepared for further education and without the tools they need to navigate an increasingly complex and technologically sophisticated world. The UW-Extension has a unique skill set and opportunity to teach, provide resources to, and partner with existing stakeholders to ensure STEM education is available to all and taught with fidelity in Trempealeau County.|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0
159|Facility and Operations Director|"Situation Statement (it's okay to list two different situation statements)Overview of Upham Woods and Current TrajectoryBackground: Upham Woods Outdoor Learning Center is an informal science learning (ISL) center that is a part of the University of Wisconsin System, currently affiliated with UW-Madison, Division of Extension. Over the last four years, Upham Woods Outdoor Learning Center's increasingly vibrant outdoor classroom and dynamic statewide outreach program have strengthened the quality, diversity, and reach of environmental education in Wisconsin. Fast Facts:  Founded in 1941 318-acre facility Served 11,237 youth and adults in 2018 from 49 Wisconsin counties; served over 500,000 Wisconsinites since 1941 Programming includes:  on-site group visits from schools, 4-H programs, scouts, etc.  outreach learning experiences across the state Current Trajectory Established by Renewed Outreach Efforts and Use of Technology 2014-2018:   Over $1.92 million in cumulative program revenue generated Over $1.01 million investment in capital projects in collaboration with UWEX administration Acquisition of over $1.45 million in extramural support grants for building environmental education capacity and expanding access to programs at Upham Woods as well as to statewide environmental education opportunities, including Digital Observation Technology Skills (DOTS):  Framework developed at Upham Woods and used statewide for integrating modern, mobile technology into outdoor, experiential science educationo 14,591 youth and adults have used DOTS since 2014o Generates hands-on engagement with technology in the context of a classic outdoor learning settingo Digital tool kits are assembled, distributed and supported by Upham Woodso Resulted in 19 peer-reviewed articles authored or co-authored by Upham staff. Upham Woods programming reach has increased 28% in the last 4 years and revenue is up 15% in the same time period. Furthermore, our reach in 2018 was the largest in 32 years and our revenue is the highest in center history.Embracing Technology Rooted in Heritage of Upham WoodsWhen the University of Wisconsin received the donation of land that would become Upham Woods, Wakelin McNeel served as the Center's first superintendent. McNeel was also known as ""Ranger Mac"", a persona he created for a Wisconsin Public Radio show that he hosted. As part of his show, he invited youth and adults from all across Wisconsin to reflect on, observe, engage, and conserve the state's wonderful natural resources. On the program, he often noted that ""If you didn't take a walk yesterday, you missed out on many things that may not come again"" (Matkin-Rawn 2004). Today, we share these same sentiments with our students, encouraging them to observe their surroundings and ask questions that enable them to better understand the world they inhabit. While Ranger Mac worked at Upham Woods in the 1930s and 1940s, many parallels exist between his service to the state and the direction Upham is headed today. Ranger Mac used the technology of the era radio to connect a statewide audience to the environment. By using a resource that was both pervasive and accessible, he drew youth and adults to issues in our natural world and also enabled them to explore Upham Woods. Today, we accomplish these same objectives through the Digital Observation Technology Skills (DOTS) program and web-based resources. Ranger Mac's approach focused on observation and wonder in the outdoors. Today, we use terms such as informal science learning (ISL), inquiry-based instruction, project-based learning and place-based education to describe this same approach. Although there have been many changes in the last 76 years at Upham Woods, it continues to serve a crucial statewide presence in environmental education outreach by leveraging an effective blend of technology and youth development, within a context of vibrant natural resources and scenic beauty.Confidence in this Well-founded ApproachThe National Research Council's research shows that ISL is guided by student inquiry about the natural world, data collection related to their inquiry, and opportunities to present their findings to peers and community members (National Research Council, 2009). Further, the National Research Council states that informal learning environments are, in principle, accessible to all learners, and evidence suggests they have particular potential for supporting learners from non-dominant groups (National Research Council, 2009). In addition to providing experiential learning opportunities grounded in environmental concepts, ISL centers like Upham Woods expand the network of educators and facilitators engaged in environmental education and provide students with ""direct access to compelling phenomena in the natural world"" (National Science Foundation, 2011).While ISL centers, such as camps and nature centers, have historically had programming legacies rooted in the natural sciences, their educational practices can be in tension with the emphasis on the adoption of modern technology that often guides contemporary STEM education (Cuthbertson, Socha, & Potter, 2004). Yet using technology in outdoor education settings holds great promise in deepening scientific connections to local places through data collection. As an example, data collection within a context of location, community, and inquiry provides a place-based approach to education that contributes to active and engaged citizens (Hougham & Kerlin, 2016; Sobel, 2004). In modern science classrooms and careers, most scientific tools are digital. Consequently, adopting digital tools requires ISL centers to strike a careful balance between retaining the connection to place that outdoor, experiential learning promotes and serving youth and educators with modern STEM curricula. Connecting this further, place-based education like that promoted at Upham Woods has been shown to connect learners' STEM engagement to their experiences in informal settings, develop their acute observation skills, and increase their capacity to care about the environment around them (Land & Zimmerman, 2015; Greenwood & Hougham, 2015)."|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

161|Addressing Nitrate Contamination of Groundwater in Rural Areas|Nitrate contamination of groundwater is an increasing problem in agricultural areas throughout the state. High-intensity row crop production, particularly in regions of susceptible soils (e.g., sandy texture, shallow groundwater), coupled with the loss of pasture-based livestock agriculture have exacerbated the problem. Groundwater quality data shows a continuing upward trend in contaminant concentrations. This has serious health implications for rural populations that rely on untreated groundwater for drinking water.|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
162|Beekeeping for Certification 2019|"Beginning beekeeping classes in Metropolitan Milwaukee presented by non-profit organizations are not very comprehensive. To maintain a beehive in many municipalities, new beekeepers are required to have taken a certified beekeeping class. Our focus groups indicated that research based beekeeping information is important for both our new and existing beekeepers. The focus groups also specifically liked the UIWEX hands-on, in the apiary, class experience. Although UW does not maintain a ""bee lab"" like the University of Minnesota, we find and share university information to help our beekeepers maintain quality hives. The program began in response to the concerns of our community gardeners in 2005, who related to us that they had low yields of squash and cucumbers. Because bees provide 100% of pollination of vine crops, we now maintain seven apiaries with forty hives in our large community gardens to help with pollination. The forty-six acre UWEX Kohl Farm Community Garden now has three apiaries and about 20 bee hives. Our high quality season-long course gives new students a chance to explore this opportunity without the risk of a substantial investment of bees and materials before they commit to this discipline. We plan to train 25 new certified beekeepers to help them comply with their local ordinances."|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
163|Building Strong Mental and Physical Wellbeing in Chippewa Count|Many of Chippewa County Families are directly impacted by opioid and methamphetamine use. The rapid rise of these toxic drugs has increased the cases of Child Protective Services throughout the county from 28 cases in 2014, to 92 cases in 2016. This increase has impacted our schools, legal communities, service providers, public health department and Department of Corrections. Babies are affected before birth and they continue to be affected through the adverse childhood trauma that they experience (Winter, L. 2016).The impacts of poverty, isolation, drug use and incarceration have been seen throughout the community by all members of the community and suggests a correlation to the top needs of the county. The results of the 2014-2015 Community Health Needs Assessment, 2017 Chippewa County Community Health Survey, and 2017 Chippewa County Youth Survey, indicate that the top health priorities in Chippewa County are mental health, substance abuse, alcohol misuse, healthy growth and development, and healthy nutrition. The data further indicates that Chippewa is above the state and/or national level in: Opioid-related and drug-related hospitalizations, driving deaths with alcohol involvement, excessive drinking, violent crimes, injury hospitalizations, hospitalizations for self-inflicted wounds, number of mentally unhealthy days, suicide death rate, obesity, and lacking in adequate access to food (Chippewa County Community Health Assessment, 2014-2015, Chippewa County Youth Survey, 2017, and Chippewa County Community Health Survey, 2017).Survey data indicates that there is a need for University of Wisconsin- Division of Extension to provide research-based/evidence based programs and provide education to inform policy development. The community needs help dealing with the occurrence and outcomes of alcohol use, drug abuse, physical wellbeing, and mental health issues that are being seen in families. Furthermore, building strong leaders in our community is important to help shape the direction of tomorrow.References2017 Chippewa County Community Health Survey, (2018).2017 Chippewa County Youth Survey, (2018).ALICE by County - United Way of Wisconsin.

164|Workforce development among under/unemployed residents in Racin|Demographics: Kenosha County is comprised of 13 municipalities (1-City, 7-Villages, 5-Towns) with a total population of just over 167,000. Racine County is comprised of 17 municipalities (2 Cities, 9 Villages, 6 Towns) with a total population of 196,000. The City of Kenosha is the fourth largest WI city with a population of just over 100,000. City of Racine follows closely behind at 77,500. Kenosha and Racine County populations are projected to grow between 30% to as much as 60% by the year 2050 according the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission's 2010 Comprehensive Plans. This population will also grow increasingly diverse demographically with respect to race and ethnicity as the white, non-Hispanic population drops off from over 70% of the current population in 2017 to just over 55% in 2050. This also reflects a growing trend of individuals speaking English as a Second Language. Natural Environment: The region has a recent legacy of poor air quality; recording the second highest number of daily alerts of WI counties between 2007 and 2013 with hazardous levels of ozone and particle pollution (WI Dept. of Natural Resources). Regional personal vehicle miles total over 4 million daily (VMT) according to WI DOT 2011 wherein nearly 43,000 daily commuters leave the county for work (US Census). These environmental impacts are exasperated by land use planning, urban sprawl, insufficient public transportation infrastructure and heavy commercial trucking. Renewable fuel sources such as wind power, hydroelectricity, and solar power, which are pollution-neutral, comprise less than one-half of one percent of our region's energy portfolio. Both Racine and Kenosha County have formidable challenges with respect to land use, wetland conservation, air quality, water quality and rapidly depleting space at their landfills due to the rapid growth and development throughout the region.Economy: Broad-based, equitable economic development also remains key to Racine and Kenosha County sustainability as both rebound from unemployment rates that in the recent recession peaked at over 10% (WI DWD Annual Unemployment Rates, 2005-2010), and is at a rate of 3.6% and 3.7 respectively in March 2018 (statewide averages at the same time were 3.2). Since the 1970s industrial productivity has slowed nationally, lending way to all-together new employment patterns. This shift was acutely felt in Kenosha and Racine through the 1980s as major employers eliminated local production facilities: Redevelopment of sizable brownfield redevelopment projects and significant workforce development and retraining needs exist. In 2017 signs of the New Economy are shaping the nature of employment, job creation and the practice of economic development with emphasis on business retention, creativity and innovation, entrepreneurship and digitization. (Kaufmann Foundation State New Economy Index). Since 2008, SE Wisconsin began a strong recovery from economic recession, and has outpaced most regions nationally to become one of the most attractive distribution/ logistics and manufacturing locations in the US. With a tight labor market of eligible employees and skill gaps across Kenosha and Racine Counties, the region has struggled to meet workforce development demands. But that was so even prior to the 2018 announcement of Wisconsin's largest economic attraction deal in state--and United States history, with Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn. This current challenge requires the region to shore up eligible employees to fill the 13,000+ net new technology jobs and reshape the built environment with a capital investment of $10 billion of private funds. And Foxconn, while hugely significant, is only one employer. The region is laden with legacy employers that will continue to grow and require a talent pool to compete. And the region will likely see many complimentary industries emerge through business high profile relocations (Haribo) and corporate expansions (Uline, Amazon). Taken together, the resulting demographic shifts, environmental impacts and infrastructure enhancements will be staggering. These will require an unprecedented degree of coordination, expertise and informed decision-making.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

166|Cropping Systems, Resource Protection and Cover Crops |Situation: There is an on-going need to utilize cropping procedures that protect water quality by reducing the amount of nutrients and sediment impacting both surface water and groundwater. Cover crops produce vegetative biomass that increase organic matter, protect soil aggregates, improve water infiltration, and help to recycle plant nutrients from one year to the next. This need is clearly identified by: Local Planning and Conversation Departments, DNR and numerous conservation groups concerned about water quality and climate change issues. The primary focus area of work includes the Sheboygan and Milwaukee River Watersheds. The Research Team includes: UW -Extension Sheboygan County, UW-Madison - Soil Science Department, Nutrient & Pest Management Program, NRCS, Planning & Resources Department, Local Soil and Water Conservation Departments and The Nature Conservancy. Through my leadership the partnerships were expanded starting in 2016 to include the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District, The Conservation Fund and Sweet Water Milwaukee.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
167|Ensuring clean drinking water|A clean and dependable supply of water is critical to ensure a high quality of life and maintain a strong economy. Groundwater is of particular importance to Wisconsin since nearly 95% of communities and all rural residents rely groundwater as their principal water supply. While municipal water supplies are subject to strict guidelines and water quality testing to ensure that water meets the criteria for safe drinking water; the estimated 900,000 households that rely on private wells (~42% of Wisconsin Residents) are not routinely tested. While drinking water standards are not enforceable for private wells, they serve as guidelines for well owners to decide whether or not to drink the water. Data collected by Extension shows that nearly 10% of wells are considered unsafe with respect to nitrate. Fifteen to twenty percent have detectable coliform bacteria which may indicate problems with the well that could allow harmful pathogens into the well. Approximately 3% and 5% contain unsafe levels of arsenic and lead, respectively. Private well owners must act as their own water utility manager, however this group often know little about the quality of their well water, where to send a sample to get tested, or what to do if there is a problem. Characteristics of rural audiences include less formalized networks, fewer interactions among the population, fewer shared activities, horizontal accountability, less specialization and more egalitarian allocation of resources; all of which can make it more challenging to effectively target messaging or implement policy changes to assist this audience. This Extension research and programming is designed to provide support and services that increase the capacity of rural residents to provide clean drinking water to their families.|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

Additionally, in middle-skill jobs (jobs that require more than a high school diploma, but less than a four year degree), over 67% of openings require, at a minimum, proficiency in productivity software such as Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word and typically other digital literacy skills (Burning Glass Technologies, Captial One, 2015).

Through the Emmett Project and the 4-H Digital Ambassadors, youth leaders will be trained as spokespeople and trainers. They will expand their voice with in the communities by providing workshops or program in STEM+C or Digital Literacy with both youth and adults. 4-Her's serve as trusted voice and have many long-standing relationships within their communities. Provided the youth with effective training they can build the relationships as leaders within the communities. The Emmett Project will serve the youth in Lincoln and Langlade counties. This STEM+C program will be open to all youth in the communities not just 4-H. Flyers were given out to local schools, the Boys & Girls Club, and local libraries. While Langlade was identified as county with a large digital divide with need for the digital literacy program. 4-H youth will become team leaders that will take their knowledge into the community for both youth and adults to learn from.|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1
169|Parent and Relationship Education (2019)|Families in Wisconsin struggle to make end meets, with 17% of our children living in poverty [1] and 31% of these children live in single parent households.[2] There are 286,829 families with 405,611 young children. In Wisconsin, 43% (172,526) of young children live in low-income families. (National: 45%)[3] We know that families perform a variety of key functions that contribute to both the mental and physical health of individuals as well as the public health and functioning of society. Throughout all developmental stages, from the prenatal period to the last years of life, strong healthy relationships help families effectively and efficiently raise healthy children, care for vulnerable members, and sustain productive workers and contributing community members. Despite recent reports of overall improvement in employment and gains in median incomes, the economic recovery in Wisconsin has been uneven. Many families continue to face challenges from low wages, depleted savings, and the increasing cost of basic household goods.Children who are born into and raised in an environment of positive relationships have a strong foundation that can help them develop into healthy adults and productive citizens. This environment of relationships involves not only parents and children but also extended family and social networks, schools and childcare providers, and others who engage with the family. Stable, nurturing relationships have a powerful protective impact on children. They help prevent exposure to multiple risks and stressors, including family violence and neglect, parental incarceration, and mental illness. Exposure to these stressors is associated with numerous poor outcomes, some of which are commonly seen across multiple generations within families and are very costly to society. In addition to contributing to prevention, safe, stable, nurturing relationships with parents and other caregivers serve as a buffer to help mitigate the damaging impacts of toxic stress. Healthy relationships help children thrive.It has long been understood that a strong parent/child relationship is a key factor in preventing negative outcomes for children. More recent research suggests that strong relationships between parents and other adults, including romantic partners, friends and extended family, can help prevent child maltreatment and improve the capacity of adults to parent effectively. My work will focus on strengthening families and enhancing relationships by: Offering Raising a Thinking Child (RTC) and I Can Problem Solve (ICPS) throughout Wood County.Using media technology as a means to reach and connect with busy families today, providing evidence and research -based information about child development and parenting practice in a digital format.

170|Produce safety program oversight and delivery|The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), the most sweeping reform of our food safety laws in more than 70 years, was signed into law in 2011. It aims to ensure the U.S. food supply is safe by shifting the focus from responding to contamination to preventing it. Food safety is an important issue for every farm. Contamination by food borne pathogens can make customers ill and have devastating impacts for farm business. In addition to being the right thing to do, food safety is increasingly becoming a required part of doing business. Many buyers require some form of food safety audit. The federal Food Safety Modernization Act also requires increased food safety regulations on farms of various sizes. FSMA establishes science-based standards for growing, harvesting, packing and holding produce on domestic and foreign farms. In Wisconsin, over 80,000 acres of fresh market vegetables, tree fruit and berries are produced in Wisconsin according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Census of Agriculture. This produce is sold directly to the public and/or wholesale to grocery stores, restaurants and schools. Farmers are expected comply with the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) Produce Safety Rule to mitigate the risk of food borne illness. Complying with this rule requires produce growers to understand and mitigate risk related to food borne pathogens in all aspects of their operations from the beginning of the growing process to the sale. To enable produce growers to improve food safety on their farms and comply with the food safety rule, they require education relevant to their operations. Fortunately, proper harvesting and handling techniques will minimize the risk of contamination as well as increase the shelf life and marketability of your products. Implementing food safety practices is simply good farming.The Produce Safety Alliance (PSA) has developed a curriculum, approved by the FDA; and is a collaboration between Cornell University, FDA, and USDA. The PSA's mandate it to prepare fresh produce growers to meet the regulatory requirements included in the United States Food and Drug Administration's Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) Produce Safety Rule. UW-Extension was granted a contract with Wisconsin Department of Agriculture to provide farm safety training, using the PSA curriculum to Wisconsin growers.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
171|Kenosha County Youth Engagement|In Kenosha County, the disparities in reading & math proficiency, graduation, and college readiness are most serve with students of color across the board. In 2016 African-Americans only represented 7% of the total Kenosha County population, and Hispanics made up 13%. Students of color (23% Hispanic & 11% African-American) make-up only 34% of the 28,813 pre-K - 12th grade Kenosha County students. African Americans hold the highest poverty rate in Kenosha County at 43%. Youth that grow up economically disadvantaged face many challenges which may cause them to be unrepresented, underestimated, undervalued, and marginalized when it comes to their academic success and overall opportunities. There is tremendous need for positive youth/adult partnerships, lifeskills, pre-college preparation & post-secondary, and career exploration programming for underrepresented students of color in Kenosha County. School administrators and staff are oftentimes over exhausted with the number of students they have at their particular schools to meet the unique needs of underrepresented students. If students are not developing the necessary skills needed in reading & math, they will not be prepared for post-secondary education or have the skills needed to go directly into the workforce.The goal of Extension is connecting UW-Colleges to the local community, through resources and expertise from the various institutions. UW-Extension Kenosha County can contribute to the greater good of Kenosha County through bridge-building access to quality enrichment opportunities for local underrepresented youth & young adults through various programming. As there is no single point of these disparities, strides can be made through the facilitation of new programming, collaborations and partnerships i.e. academic enrichment, tutoring, and social-emotional development programs, pre-college and post-secondary awareness, and career exploration. Combined with increased parent involvement, the aforementioned engagement activities have proven to have direct impact on the achievement gap. Utilizing student-centered programming and approaches that will effectively address disparities that exist among student's unrepresented youth in Kenosha County.The cost of not engaging this population of youth will continue to widen the academic achievement, which will have a domino effect on the gap in post-secondary attainment, and the economic and workforce shortfall.|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0
172|Regional Food System Development (2019)|"Encouraging Community Economic Development by increasing activity and connectivity within Regional Food System of Ashland and Bayfield CountiesFood and agriculture are integral to the economic, social and cultural fabric of Ashland and Bayfield Counties. Over the past decade, there has been significant focused effort put forth by many stakeholders to to build regional wealth, vitality and social equity through the development the regional food system.Within the last 10 years, there have been several new additions and expansions within the local food system including: new small diversified vegetable and fruit farms; new wineries, distilleries, and cideries; new restaurants focused on buying locally and offering local food on their menus; a new food producers cooperative that has branched out into a broader regional markets; new local food-related events for both community members and visitors; consistency and growth at farmers markets; presence of multiple CSAs; growth in programs providing access to local fresh fruit and vegetables for low-income community members; a growing presence of food sovereignty in the region; growth in capacity of organizations providing emergency food to populations in need; an new food center with commercial kitchen and co-packing capacity; growth in micro-loans available to producers; increase in quantity of local foods stocked at grocery stores; growth in commitments to purchase local food from cornerstone institutions; and a new degree program at the local college for sustainable farming and food systems. A 2018 Local Food Survey conducted by the Center for Rural Communities at Northland College notes the following: ""a large majority of households share values related to access to healthy food, a regional culture of small farms, and water quality in Chequamegon Bay. 92 percent of households would like more of the food they purchase to be produced in Ashland and Bayfield Counties. A majority of households are willing to pay more for food produced locally. Over 45 percent of households are willing to contribute to community programs that support wider distribution and greater affordability of local food.... Taken together these values and beliefs suggest that there is support for growing the local food economy and making sure that households across the income spectrum are able to participate and benefit from its development.""Despite these numerous recent developments and significant public support, the food system of the greater Chequamegon Bay Area has not yet matured to become economically sustainable or self-perpetuating. CSA sales have declined, value added producers are facing continued challenges with growth and distribution to broader markets, and local food is still out of reach for many local residents due to both real and perceived barriers. While great effort has been put forth, success has been modest. Many of the expected benefits, including sustainable livelihood creation, increased entrepreneurship, and increased access to local food, and other useful ""spillover effects"" have yet to be realized. This has left key stakeholders questioning whether food is a viable economic driver for this geographically isolated region with such a small population."|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

174|"Co-Parenting -- ""Children Caught in the Middle"""|"Outagamie County Family Court systems continues to see a major request for co-parentng classses for both mandated and non-mandated family members. Extension has been and continues to be a co-presenter for this monthly event. Along with this, there has been a documented need for education for never-married couples who are raising children together in two households. The Co-parenting classes are offered on a monthly basis. Extension is the key coordinator of evaluation for end of program and a follow-up evaluation process.Besides this class, there are also numerous adults responsible for providing a home for children who's parents are not in the picture due to drug addictions, incarceration of mental health issues. The number of adults in this role is increasing.As a result a support group for families entitled, ""It's All Relative"" has been developed to offer monthly family suppers, child care activities and adult support programs. Extension has worked with the Department of Health and Human Services to offer this monthly support group."|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0
175|Financial Security Programming 2019|Although current indicators show that the state of the economy is on the upswing, there are still many individuals and families in Madison and surrounding Dane County that struggle to manage their household finances. Reduced earning power due to racial income disparities, layoffs, reduction in work hours and decreased salary and benefits, results in families having to pay more out of pocket for basic needs. For many families and individuals, just one shift in the flow of financial resources (e.g., loss of a job, death of a breadwinner, divorce, or long-term illness) can be detrimental to financial stability and, if persistent, will impact financial security. Low income families are particularly vulnerable because they typically have little or no saving reserves to fall back on when unforeseen expenses arise.As the number of Dane County children growing up in poverty continues to grow, it is highly likely that their care-givers are not financially capable to consistently provide food on a daily basis. According to the United Way, over 16,000 children are food insecure in Dane County. Low income family care-givers struggle to make ends meet as a result of job insecurity; rising food and housing costs and decreasing public assistance programs, and the impact on their children's long-term health and ability to succeed in school is severely jeopardized.|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0
176|Expanding Access|"Demographically, the United States continues to grow more diverse and this demographic trend is even more apparent nationwide with the youth population (Chart 1).Chart 1 (Child Trends, 2016)Wisconsin's racial minority population increased 500 percent between 1970 and 2013 including significant increases in Latino/Hispanic, Black/African American and Asian populations (Gordon, 2016). Similarly, the growing number of foreign-born youth and families provide opportunities for 4-H youth development to grow its membership base and reach new audiences. In 1990, census figures showed the foreign-born population at about 121,500; in 2015, that number had increased to nearly 279,000. This represents an increase of 130% over the 25 year span (Long, Jones, & and Ewald, 2017). These audiences are historically underserved by 4-H Youth Development. Families and individuals may lack familiarity with 4-H (knowledge barrier) or unable to access 4-H programs by traditional means (organizational barrier). 4-H Youth Development can benefit by welcoming youth and volunteers from diverse backgrounds. As an organization, UW-Extension needs diversity in its staff, volunteers and learners to effectively participate in an intercultural and global world.The Wisconsin 4-H Community Club program had 29,912 youth (grades 5K-13) enrolled in 2017. Of those youth enrolled in 4-H Community Clubs, 94.7% identified as White (4-H Youth Development State Office, 2018). Given that Wisconsin's population is 86% White according to Census 2010, it is clear that the community club program does not reflect the state's demographic profile (United States Census Bureau, 2010).In 2017, 10,787 adults had been certified as 4-H Youth Development volunteers of those 97.1% of these adults self-identified as White (4-H Youth Development State Office, 2018).In addition to the 4-H Community Club, 4-H Youth Development in Wisconsin offers programs for youth that include 4-H Afterschool programs, in-school enrichment programs, and group educational experiences at camps, demonstrations, library programs and more. In 2017, 27,392 youth participated in these experiences across the state and 82.3% of these youth were identified as White (4-H Youth Development State Office, 2018). Although gains have been made in delivering educational programs to underserved youth through these types of modalities, more effort must be made to provide racially and ethnically diverse 4-H participants with all the opportunities available through 4-H club programs, including staff support, awards, educational trips and scholarships.In April of 2016, National 4-H launched a new campaign aimed at rebranding 4-H as a strategy to increase the number of ethnically and racially diverse youth participating in the program. National 4-H has set their goal high. By 2025, 4-H wants to add 4 million new members and in so doing double the number of African American and Hispanic youth engaged in the program. This goal is especially pertinent in Wisconsin where the state's youth of color face extreme racial disparity across all measures of well-being and could benefit greatly from quality youth development programs. According to the 2016 KIDS COUNT Data Book, Wisconsin ranked 12th among the 50 states in overall child well-being, but persistent challenges hinder children living in immigrant families and children of color, especially African-American, Latino and American Indian children (The Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2018; Kids Forward, 2018). Black children and American Indian children in Wisconsin are more than four times as likely to live in poverty as White non-Hispanic children, and Hispanic children are nearly three times as likely as White children (Kids Forward, 2018). In 2015, a 24/7 Wall Street Special Report listed Wisconsin as the worst state in the nation for Black Americans. Authors citied home ownership, unemployment, and incarceration rates as key indicators of extreme racial inequality (Frohlich, Sauter, & Stebbins, 2015). According to a 2002 study conducted at the Institute for Applied Research in Youth Development, Tufts University, researchers discovered that, compared to their peers, youth involved in 4-H programs excel in several areas. 4-H Youth are:Four times more likely to make contributions to their communities (Grades 7-12);Two times more likely to be civically active (Grades 8-12); Two times more likely to make healthier choices (Grade 7);Two times more likely to participate in Science, Engineering and Computer Technology programs during out-of-school time (Grades 10 - 12); and4-H girls are two times more likely (Grade 10) and nearly three times more likely (Grade 12) to take part in science programs compared to girls in other out-of-school time activities (Tufts University).Adapting what works in 4-H Youth Development programming to the needs of emerging and underserved audiences is a major goal of the Expanding Access Team. We know from recent focus groups conducted with diverse stakeholders that parents are interested in these programs and willing to assist with programming in their communities. In April 2017, 4-H Youth Development was reviewed for Civil Rights Compliance by a team from NIFA-USDA (Hicks, 2017). The review was conducted to determine whether UWEX was complying with the provisions of the U.S. Civil Rights law and USDA's Civil Rights rules and regulations. The team found significant areas for improvement. Serious civil rights concerns include: the ability to collect participant datainequitable access to participate in activities and opportunitiessupporting a diverse and inclusive volunteer basethe absence of a strategic plan for expanding accessthe lack of a diverse and demographically representative advisory group *********************************************************************************UW-Extension and its 4-H Youth Development program are charged with making ""all reasonable efforts to reach protected audiences (women and people of racial and ethnic minority groups) with special outreach activities"" by Title VI of the Civil Rights Law of 1964, and ""expanding access to 4-H opportunities, services and education to groups or segments of the community that have traditionally not been served or are currently not being served by an organization to the same extent as other groups or segments have been or are being served"" (Civil Rights Leadership Team, 2012). This law, in and of itself, requires staff to continuously seek ways to reach and make welcome new, diverse audiences. In Walworth CountyReaching Latino/Hispanic audiences is a high priority, particularly in the Delavan-Darien and Whitewater School Districts where they reside in larger numbers than elsewhere. 2012-2013 district demographic data shows that 44.4% of the Delavan-Darien School District students are Latino/Hispanic. Greatschools.org reports that about 32.3% of the Whitewater Unified School District students identify as Latino/Hispanic. The overall Walworth County population is 29.5% Latino/Hispanic.We are fortunate to house the Wisconsin School for the Deaf, which poses unique programming opportunities.Seven school buildings in three communities county-wide serve populations in which 50% or more qualify for free and reduced lunch.With the exception of the past year, during which the Walworth County community club program enjoyed an increase in membership of approximately 50 youth, the trend has been a very slow decline in membership during the last decade. The county 4-H Expansion & Review Committee and county 4-H leadership have set goals to increase community club membership while continuing to reach new diverse youth in creative new ways.Substantial interest in the 4-H community club program exists as evidenced by participation in the county's annual Back-to-4-H Night open house event for potential new families. Participation in 2018 = 101 4-H age youth. Participation in 2017 = 199 4-H-age youth. Efforts to make Spanish-speaking families feel welcome have included making a Spanish language interpreter available throughout the event each year since 2016, and noting the availability of the interpreter on the marking materials directly beginning in 2018. The 4-H Science Lab program was initiated in 2011 and has been a successful means of exposing otherwise untapped audiences to 4-H while establishing credibility as an effective and valued educational partner in the schools; since its inception, the 4-H Science Lab program has resulted in 8871 contacts, 23% of which have been Hispanic/Latino; the program is also one that the Wisconsin School for the Deaf has taken advantage of participating in.The 4-H Ag Technology Day program, held twice in 2014, and once in 2018 creates a welcoming environment for Delavan-Darien School District 4th and 5th graders. As noted previously, district demographic data from 2012-2013 shows that 44.4% of students report as Latino/Hispanic.The Elkhorn OPtions Homeschool Program has a strong presence in Walworth County and has been a proponent and avid user of 4-H outreach in past years.Several summer school programs, a 21st Century Learning Community afterschool program, and several park district and day care programs exist in Walworth County and have reached out to 4-H staff in the past for programming; they remain potential programming partners.

178|Racial Equity in Entrepreneurship |Nationally, minorities and immigrants start new businesses at higher rates than non-Hispanic white people despite the fact that minority entrepreneurs face a wide range of challenges, including barriers in accessing information, technical supports in terms of business planning, and financial resources necessary for business startup and growth (Bonds, 2007; Erdmann, 2016; Freeland & Keister, 2016; Kopkin, 2017). Many factors (cultural and social) affect the ability of minority entrepreneurs to interact with and use services offered by public and private organizations such as economic development corporations and financial institutions (Garcia-Pabon & Klima, 2017; Moon et al., 2014; Zarrugh, 2007). These organizations, on the other hand, fall short of adequate in recognizing and reaching out to minorities partly because they are largely staffed by non-Hispanic white employees with limited intercultural experience and communication skills to effectively engage business owners from different racial and ethnic background (Brown & Parkins, 2015; Valdivia et al., 2012). This results in alienation of minorities, disconnecting them from available services in their communities (Hohn 2005; Kelderhouse, 2002; Lamie, 2003).While Wisconsin is not a top immigrant-receiving state nor among the most diverse by race and ethnicity of residents, minority business ownership is skyrocketing here. In 2007, minority residents represented 14.6% of the total population and owned 6.2% of all firms in the state (Obuko & Planting, 2015). From 2002-2007 the number of MBEs in WI increased by 47.5% and their gross receipts increased 77.5%, while the minority population as a whole increased only 13.6% (Obuko & Planting, 2015). The largest number of minority-owned businesses (11,276) in WI were owned by African-Americans (Obuko & Planting, 2015). In spite of these impressive growth statistics, there is no statewide effort to accurately track the numbers or performance of minority-owned businesses. The WI Department of Administration manages the WI Supplier Diversity Program which invites women-owned, racial- and ethnic-minority-owned, and disabled veteran-owned businesses to bid for government services contracts. However, this is voluntary and only benefits certain types of businesses. There are only a few peer-reviewed research efforts that document minority business efforts in WI (Bonds, 2007; Erdmann, 2016; Squires &  'Connor, 2001). Minority ownership data by county exists (2012 Survey of Business Owners, U.S. Census) but has not yet been compared to the working adult population to find parity. Locally, Extension in Fond du Lac County is a founding member of IGNITE! Business Success, an entrepreneurship development system (Lichtenstein & Lyons, 2001) of 16 entities united in a collaborative since 2014. At that time, none of the partners were routinely serving minority-owned businesses, even though they were quite visible in the area and well-established. The partners were also unaware of the scope of demographic change taking place in the county. Specifically, the white population increased by one percent between the last two Census counts (2000 and 2010) while the number of Latino (120%), African-American (43%), American Indian (19%), and Asian (33%) residents of the area increased by double-digit percentages (U.S. Census Bureau). This trend is expected to continue, with all area school districts reporting a minimum of five percent students of color, and 24 percent in the largest district (Department of Public Instruction, 2016). To respond to this situation, I have already:  Coordinated a research project which obtained interviews from 35 minority owners in 2014-2015,   Begun raising issues of equity, access, and race in IGNITE! conversations, teaching the white economic development professionals about the importance of a racial equity lens in our programming Built relationships with additional entrepreneurs of color and begun programming specifically for their needs   Supporting the Regional People of Color Business Association (RPOCBA) based in Oshkosh which has led to opportunities to work with business owners in Outagamie, Winnebago, & Brown Counties.  Submitted an article for publication in the journal Community Development, co-authored by Dr. Joseph Malual (Chippewa, Baron, & Eau Claire Counties). It is still in review as of 2.1.19.As a result of a deeper collaboration with Dr. Tessa Conroy (Madison), Ihave learned that wide and supportive networks are a key to minority- andwomen-owned business success, more than content-based programming. I will framemy work in 2019 from this perspective.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
179|Workforce Preparation and Life Skills Development|"National Data: From the 1990s on, critical job skills identified by employers have included a mix of soft skills and technological acumen. Research shows that cognitive skills like reading, writing and arithmetic and non-cognitive skills such as responsibility, independence, and initiative are important in predicting academic and employment success. These non-cognitive skills are also called ""enabling"", ""soft"", ""interpersonal"", ""applied"", ""workforce"", ""life"", ""knowledge economy"", ""career"", or ""21st Century"" skills depending on which sector is defining them (Garcia 2014). They also need to be independent, learn things on their own, and manage themselves without relying on others. Many students leave high school with the skills to work in jobs that are no longer available in our country. Only one third of graduating students are ready for college, yet in order to earn a decent wage, most will need at least some postsecondary education (Wagner 2008).The American Management Association (AMA), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are both national and international in focus. The Definition and Selection of Competencies Project, created by OECD (an organization of 30 industrialized nations) and the Partnership for 21st Century Skills (a group that is comprised of representatives from the business community, education leaders and policy makers) say it is critical for young people to develop 21st Century skills in order to function effectively in today's knowledge-focused economy (AMA 2015) (P21 2015) (OECD 2005).In an article from the Journal of Instructional Psychology, 13 job critical job skills were rated by numerous Fortune 500 companies, with survey response from 1970 and 1997 reported. Topping off the list for 1997 were: 1) teamwork, 2) problem solving, 3) interpersonal skills, 4) oral communication, and 5) listening (Cassel and Kolstad 1998).The 2010 American Management Association Critical Skills Survey Executive Summary reports ""employees need to think critically, solve problems, innovate, collaborate and communicate more effectively at every level within an organization."" (AMA 2010). A survey conducted by Pennsylvania State University in 1992 to 1993 identified the following qualifications as rating of top importance among 700 employers: oral and written communication skills, interpersonal skills, proficiency in field of study/technical competence, demonstrated ability for teamwork, and demonstrated leadership (Davis & Miller, 1996). A trend noted by Davis and Miller in their research is that businesses are relying more and more on people working in teams.More recent research has also shown teambuilding and communication skills to be of utmost importance to employers, along with problem-solving, decisiveness, and workflow prioritization (Adams, 2014). Ku generalizes the most sought after skills as fitting into three broad categories: life skills, literacy skills, and learning skills, and identifies three popular career tracks as computer systems analysis, computer software development, and civil engineering (Ku 2014). An article in U.S. News & World Report identifies seven skills employers are looking for; these are: social media literacy, critical thinking, sales experience, project management, writing, problem solving, and fluency in computer languages (Graves 2013).A key difference in the expectations of employers going forward revolves around literacy. For today's (and tomorrow's) employers, literacy no longer refers to one's ability to read and write, but also their ability to navigate online communication platforms. Today's youth are born into a world where technology is part of how they learn, communicate, and experience life (Ku 2014).Wisconsin Data: In Wisconsin, the Governor's office has established workforce development goals that serves as the basis for local/regional responses to economic development and workforce needs, including a plan for youth (Department of Workforce Development 2013). The soft skills/life skills previously identified align with the Governor's goals for Wisconsin's ""emerging workforce"" - youth (Western Wisconsin Workforce Development Board, Inc. 2014).4-H Data: Students gain many skills during school, which is typically a small part of their day. As an out-of-school-time program, 4-H Youth Development has been preparing youth for a successful future for years. With changes in the economy, types of available jobs and technology, 4-H Youth Development can make a valuable impact to successfully prepare youth for postsecondary education and future employment by being intentional about integrating workforce development skills in programs (Cochran et al 2010).Pierce County is a part of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Statistical Area and due to its close proximity to this area there are numerous opportunities to expose young people and adults to a wide variety of job settings. 4-H is a large program in the county and this closeness to the Twin Cities combined with the large numbers of members taking projects and volunteers who work in the Twin Cities area will provide an excellent path for teaching about workforce preparation and how to use life skills wisely to ease into the world of work."|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1

Many students leave high school with the skills to work in jobs that are no longer available in our country. Only one third of graduating students are ready for college, yet in order to earn a decent wage, most will need at least some postsecondary education (Wagner 2008).The American Management Association (AMA), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are both national and international in focus. The Definition and Selection of Competencies Project, created by OECD (an organization of 30 industrialized nations) and the Partnership for 21st Century Skills (a group that is comprised of representatives from the business community, education leaders and policy makers) say it is critical for young people to develop 21st Century skills in order to function effectively in today's knowledge-focused economy (AMA 2015) (P21 2015) (OECD 2005). -In an article from the Journal of Instructional Psychology, 13 job critical job skills were rated by numerous Fortune 500 companies, with survey response from 1970 and 1997 reported. Topping off the list for 1997 were: 1) teamwork, 2) problem solving, 3) interpersonal skills, 4) oral communication, and 5) listening (Cassel and Kolstad 1998). -The 2010 American Management Association Critical Skills Survey Executive Summary reports ""employees need to think critically, solve problems, innovate, collaborate and communicate more effectively at every level within an organization."" (AMA 2010).  -A survey conducted by Pennsylvania State University in 1992 to 1993 identified the following qualifications as rating of top importance among 700 employers: oral and written communication skills, interpersonal skills, proficiency in field of study/technical competence, demonstrated ability for teamwork, and demonstrated leadership (Davis & Miller, 1996). A trend noted by Davis and Miller in their research is that businesses are relying more and more on people working in teams. -More recent research has also shown teambuilding and communication skills to be of utmost importance to employers, along with problem-solving, decisiveness, and workflow prioritization (Adams, 2014). Ku generalizes the most sought after skills as fitting into three broad categories: life skills, literacy skills, and learning skills, and identifies three popular career tracks as computer systems analysis, computer software development, and civil engineering (Ku 2014). An article in U.S. News & World Report identifies seven skills employers are looking for; these are: social media literacy, critical thinking, sales experience, project management, writing, problem solving, and fluency in computer languages (Graves 2013). -A key difference in the expectations of employers going forward revolves around literacy. For today's (and tomorrow's) employers, literacy no longer refers to one's ability to read and write, but also their ability to navigate online communication platforms. Today's youth are born into a world where technology is part of how they learn, communicate, and experience life (Ku 2014). Wisconsin Data: In Wisconsin, the Governor's office has established workforce development goals that serves as the basis for local/regional responses to economic development and workforce needs, including a plan for youth (Department of Workforce Development 2013). The soft skills/life skills previously identified align with the Governor's goals for Wisconsin's ""emerging workforce"" - youth (Western Wisconsin Workforce Development Board, Inc. 2014).Milwaukee County Data:The challenges that many individuals and families in Milwaukee face are complex, with roots in historical segregation and racism, generational poverty, low-quality educational systems and more. Many young people in Milwaukee's most distressed neighborhoods grow up with trauma as a daily reality due to violence, emotional and physical abuse, addiction, lack of support from parent/role model. Additionally, the public school system often does not prepare young people with the skills and/or confidence they need to identify and pursue post-secondary goals. The segregation and lack of understanding of/empathy towards other communities and cultures, as well as what is portrayed by the media, perpetuate stereotypes and misunderstandings that contribute to an overall sense of apathy and hopelessness for too many young people in Milwaukee. It is estimated that 33% of children in Milwaukee County live in households where income in the past 12 months was below poverty level, and 63% of children qualify for free or reduced lunch (www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/wisconsin/2015/measure/factors/24/data). 83% of children in Milwaukee Public Schools meet the federal qualifying standard to receive free or reduced lunch (http://mps.milwaukee.k12.wi.us/MPS-English/CFO/Bud...). Extreme disparities exist when comparing data from Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS) to data for the state. Students attending MPS schools are five times as likely to be truant. 62% of MPS students graduate in four years, compared to 89% at the state level. Of those 62%, only 57% go on to a two or four-year college, compared to 74% at the state level. 13% of teachers in MPS do not hold a license for their assignment, compared to 1.6% for the state. Only 3.5% of FTE in MPS have five or more years of experience, compared to 75.2% at the state level. The suspension rate in MPS is 13.6%, compared to 3.9% for the state. And of those 13.6%, only 59.1% of those that are eligible to return actually come back to school (wisedash.dpi.wi.gov/Dashboard/portalHome.jsp).A Community Needs Assessment (21 stakeholder interview, 4 focus groups with teens) conducted in 2018 revealed the following data/information:  -There are significant gaps in programming for young people between the ages of 18 and 24; most programming ends at age 18 or high school graduation, though many young people are not prepared to pursue post-secondary goals at that point and would benefit from continued programming/support.  -Young people want (and need) programming that focuses on social and emotional development (skills including communication, teamwork, responsible decision making, goal setting, critical thinking, etc.) and job skills.   -Young people want and need connections to both their own communities and communities outside of their neighborhoods; programming needs to expose young people to diverse experiences, people and post-secondary options.   -Strong and trusting youth-adult partnerships are critical to effect and impactful programming.  -Youth voice needs to be infused into program development and implementation.  -Resources and support around mental health need to be available for both young people and youth-serving staff alike. -Greater resources and opportunities need to be dedicated to professional development and training for direct-service staff, including how to develop social and emotional skills through programming, mental health, positive communication, and self-care (particularly for staff)."|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0
181|Organizational Leadership Development|Ashland County has many local governments, nongovernmental organizations, associations, and civic clubs; many are experiencing decreasing participation as current members age or retire from their roles. Many are looking for new members, new or enhanced functions to attract interest in their missions, and local governmental officials are often unopposed in their elections. These kinds of groups need help finding new roles, new members, fundraising, and enhanced leadership capacity to accomplish goals.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
182|Community & County-based Correctional Systems and Families |Children learn in the most expected places. For many children, classrooms, childcare settings, and their own homes provide safe and friendly learning environments. Yet, for increasing numbers of young children, unexpected spaces in criminal justice-related settings such as county jail visiting areas are learning spaces. Too often, the learning that occurs in these less than child-friendly environments can be frightening and harmful. These children of incarcerated parents remain largely an invisible population despite being at risk for a host of negative outcomes.Our recent collaboration with UW-Madison and U-MN Pediatrics Department on ground-breaking NIH research studying young children with jailed parents found that young children (aged 3-8) visiting their parents in county jails had increased emotional and conduct problems, hyperactivity, and peer problems than the national norm. Our study also revealed that these young children had delays in developmental milestones, particularly in reading, talking, and listening skills, and waited 24 minutes in the jail lobby before the visit with their parent, and astonishingly, some children waited over 80 minutes.Bringing more literacy and language-rich resources into these children's lives is critical to their wellbeing. Poor readers are more likely to drop out of school and poor literacy undermines job success. And, parents whose literacy abilities are compromised are less likely to be able to help their children succeed academically. Interventions that support the language and literacy skills of children with incarcerated parents are critical.|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0
183|Building Volunteer Capacity (2019)|"Volunteers are Forest County's most valuable asset in strengthening the cultural, natural and built systems of Forest County. Expanding the capacity of the volunteer base to include the delivery of quality youth-led, adult guided programs to connect our youth to these systems is necessary to encourage mental-health well-being of both adults and youth of Forest county. In 2018, Forest County had nine adult volunteers registered as 4-H leaders. The demographics of volunteers were 89% female and 11% male with 100% of the volunteers being white. Forest County demographics indicates there is a potential audience of volunteers who reflect several racial and ethnic groups who are currently not volunteering in Youth Development programs including members of the Forest County Potawatomi community and the Sokaogon Chippewa community.The 2018 Forest County Youth Risk Behavior survey states that ""31% of Forest County high school students reported that they felt so sad or hopeless almost every day for two weeks or more in a row that they stopped doing some usual activities. This figure represents a 10% increase over the 2016 report.""1In addition, Forest County ranked 70 out of 72 in the state of Wisconsin's Quality of Life outcome with adults in Forest County reporting 3.9 days in the past 30 days that their mental health was not good. 2Research has found that ""participation in voluntary services in significantly predictive of better mental and physical health, life satisfaction, self-esteem, happiness, lower depressive systems, psychological distress, and mortality and functional inability."" Public health experts agree that volunteering should be promoted ""as a kind of healthy lifestyle, especially for the social subgroups of elders, ethnic minorities, those with little education, single people and unemployed people"". 31. 2018 Youth Health Profile.

184|Grain Crop Management with an emphasis on Pest Management (2019|University of Wisconsin-Extension in Door and Kewaunee Counties have an informal agricultural educator specialization agreement whereby the Door County educator provides programming for crops and soils in both counties, and the Kewaunee Agent covers dairy and livestock. Although neighbors, the agricultural environment in Door and Kewaunee County is quite different. Door County is more than twice the size of Kewaunee County, yet Kewaunee County has 45% more acres of harvested agricultural land (86,505 ac in Door County and 134,654 ac in Kewaunee County; USDA Census of Agriculture 2012). Consequently, in Door County, farmers steward 43% of the county's land, whereas in Kewaunee County, farmers steward 81% of the land (S. Deller, Value and Economic Impact, 2012). The types of crops grown in the two counties also varies. In Kewaunee County, dairy farming is the primary form of agriculture, generating $190 million in milk sales. Door County also has a significant dairy industry ($38.5 million in milk sales) and many farmers grow cash crops, but there is much more diversity in the crops grown. Fruit and berry sales generate $4.4 million towards Door County's economy, compared to the $0.36 million in Kewaunee County. Despite these differences, the similar climatic and geological environment, especially between Kewaunee County and Southern Door County makes many Extension programs and research projects relevant to both counties. In 2016, this agriculture educator conducted a needs assessment survey sent to farmers in Door and Kewaunee County regarding their crop and farm management needs. One hundred fifty six surveys were returned (34% response rate), with exactly 2/3 of the responders from Door County and the remaining 1/3 from Kewaunee County. Overall, the number one issue identified was weed management. Disease and insect management were also in the top ten, making pest management overall a top priority. In this survey, farmers were also asked to mark all crops that they grow. Of the 156 returned surveys, 63% of the responders indicated that they grow corn, 60% grow alfalfa, 53% grow wheat, 44% grow oats, and 44% grow soybeans. After that the next highest crop that was marked on the survey was 11% of the farmers indicating that they grow apples and many other specialty crops were listed after that. While many of the agronomic crops are grown for forage, these survey results point out the importance that grain crops (corn, wheat, oats, and soybeans) have to this area. For this reason, it is important to do programming specific to the needs of grain crop production including information on pest management, profitable farming, as well as soil health, agricultural risk management, and marketing. Additionally, the first confirmed finding of glyphosate-resistant waterhemp in Door County in 2017 will make efficient and informed weed management critical to prevent herbicide resistant weeds spreading throughout the county. Given current crop prices, farm stress management is also an emerging priority.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
185|Financial Security Programming (2019)|"Clark County is a large rural farming county with 92% of its population living in rural environments. Approximately 47% of its births in 2018 were of Amish/Mennonite faith.The isolation and strong rural traditions are a tremendous opportunity for UW-Madison's Division of Extension to become the resource for current information in the county. The mission of UW-Cooperative Extension is to extend the knowledge and resources of the University of Wisconsin to people where they live and work. When people are isolated, the mission becomes even more relevant to the residents lives. Demographic data indicates that Clark County is struggling in some key areas. It is the sixth poorest county in the state which results in a high percentage of children living in poverty. The county has a low high school graduation rate and Clark County also has the lowest percent of individuals age 25-44 with some post-secondary education (43.1%) in the state. In the 18-24 population it is estimated that 37.3% of the population has less than a high school graduation. Only 2.7% of that population has a college degree or higher (U.S American FactFinder, 2015) . The lack of a diploma leads directly to severely diminished opportunities for individuals as well as an estimated $260,000 in lost earnings, taxes and productivity. (Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2010) By 2020, 65% of all jobs, compared to 28 % in 1973, will require some form of post-secondary education, according to a new report from the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce.While these factors warrant action in any regard, Clark County's situation was more pressing for the following reason. Clark County is the state's leading dairy producer. This accomplishment is both good and bad news, for the county's prosperity is invested in a single changing industry and therefore vulnerable, as we saw recently. When Canada changed policy and refused to accept super refined milk from the United States, the county instantly saw more than a dozen local dairy farms on the brink of bankruptcy. Clearly an economy that rests on one leg is vulnerable to any change in the environment. While an economically diverse economy brings stability and new forms of employment, it is also clear that our modern agribusiness is increasingly data and technology driven. Preparing children for educational success by promoting nurturing and healthy environments is crucial to future careers. Reading proficiency among fourth-grade youths across the United States has become a major concern. Approximately two thirds (66%) of all fourth-grade students and 80% of all low-income fourth-grade students in the United States are not reading at their grade level (U.S. Department of Education, 2013). Reading proficiency at an early age is not only vital to improving the quality of life for children in general and at-risk children specifically, it is crucial for sustaining the nation's workforce. The nation's workforce must be composed of literate citizens who have the skills and education required to function in society. However, according to Manyika, Lund, Auguste, and Ramaswamy (2012), the United States is expected to have a shortage of 1.5 million workers with college degrees yet a surplus of 6 million unemployed individuals without high school diplomas by the year 2020. In order to sow the seeds for children's future economic prosperity and societal well-being, a long term goals involving community action towards what I call ""Future Ready Families"" needs to be initiated. There are three educational vectors that are addressed. Focus on school success and readiness through increased exposure to early literacy and to parenting techniques found in healthy families. Academic achievement is positively associated with the degree to which the parent-child relationship is characterized by parental acceptance, nurturance, encouragement, involvement and responsiveness to the child's needs.  Establish financial literacy in families, because these are correlated to family stability, school success, and post-secondary education probability. Promote lifestyle actions through evidence based programs that help build protective factors and strengthen families and create optimal child development."|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0

Since 1972 Milwaukee County Extension has provided garden space and educational resources to help all families that seek space to garden. The benefits of community gardening extend beyond food security. Although fresh vegetables and saving money are important, gardeners report that exercise, social relationships, passing along family traditions, and becoming better stewards of the urban ecosystem are also important.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
188|Tapping Into Our Maple Syrup Economy (2019)|Commercial maple syrup production is an untapped asset for economic development in Iron County. Across the country Wisconsin ranks as the 4th largest maple syrup producer, behind Vermont, New York and Maine, and ahead of Michigan and Minnesota1. Although Iron County contains some of Wisconsin's densest distributions of sugar maple2, there are very few maple syrup producers with records of commercial production3. Iron County UW-Extension recognizes an opportunity to bolster economic development in the county by providing technical assistance and network facilitation to potential producers.1. 2016-2018 United States Maple Syrup Production Statistics, posted June 2018 by National Agricultural Statistics Service, https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Maryland/Publications/News_Releases/2018/Maple%20Syrup%202018.pdf2.

189|Health and Well-Being Programming (2019)|Physical Activity has been shown to reduce the risk for chronic health conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and certain types of cancer (1, 2). In addition, physical activity helps with weight management, improving mental health, and strengthens muscles and bones (1, 2). Physical inactivity has also been associated with increasing the risk for chronic disease (3). According to County Health Rankings, only 86% of Wisconsinites report having access to physical activity, with reporting of the lowest access to exercise opportunities at 2% and the highest at 99%. In addition, 21% of Wisconsin residents report that they get no leisure time physical activity (4).As a member of the Active Communities team, I will strive to increase physical activity opportunities for all members of the community using Active School and Active Communities Strategies, StrongWomen and other evidence-based programs. By using evidence-based programs to increase physical activity in schools and communities, and by increasing access to physical activity opportunities, individuals will have the knowledge and ability to be more physically active to improve their health. In Price County, I will enhance and improve physical activity levels across the community and thus, improve the health and overall quality of life of Price County residents.|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0
190|Strengthening Richland County 4-H Clubs (2019)|Research shows that high quality programs are more likely to foster positive youth developmental outcomes. High quality programs are characterized by 4 key elements: 1) safe, inclusive, and welcoming environment, 2) supportive and caring adults, 3) content that simultaneously challenges and sparks passion and interest, and 4) high levels of youth voice in program decision making. Together, these elements promote youth engagement, and in turn, the developmental and practical skills for youth to succeed. Regardless of the type of program (in-school, after-school, on-going, or sporadic), programs that focus on maximizing each of the high quality elements are more likely to be engaging for participants. These key elements are especially important for 4-H and Extension-based Positive Youth Development programs because each element is within the control of program educators and participants. The elements can change and improve over time. By monitoring and evaluating each of the key elements, program leaders can adapt and improve the program to maximize positive youth development outcomes for all participants. Research with 4-H members nationally has shown that programs that implement these elements contribute to positive developmental outcomes including: 1) academic motivation and success, 2) social competence, 3) personal standards, 4) contributions to others, 5) connections to others, and 6) personal responsibility. In turn, these developmental outcomes in the longer term contribute to increased academic and vocational success, civic engagement, economic stability, and overall wellbeing.In Richland County, there are eleven community clubs and one afterschool 4-H club, with a current enrollment of 271. With a new 4-H club starting in February 2019, enrollments will be slightly over the 278 members in 2018. Although membership remains fairly constant, participation in county and statewide 4-H programs has increased during the past 3 years.During the past two years, 50% (10 out of 20) 4-H club co-leaders are new in that role.|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1
191|Human Develop and Relationship Programming (2019)|"With 29.3% of the population being under the age of 18, Clark County ranks second in the state in this category (County Health Rankings, 2017) According to the Clark County Health Department, currently 42% of all new births are to members of the Amish/Mennonite community. This indicates that the community has a large percentage of families with children or families with many children. However, Clark County cannot be simply classified as a ""young"" county because of its unique age distribution The County substantially exceeds the state in the share of population under 18 years old (29%) and share of population 65 and over. To put it simply, Clark County has a lot of children and a lot of elderly compared to the rest of the state. Part of this unique and somewhat strange dynamic is caused by a tangible Amish population. The Amish are generally associated with high birth rates and consequently, a young population. The high share of a population 65 or older is typical of rural counties.Clark County is the sixth poorest county in the state. The median household income is $43,147 which is $10,000 less than the state of Wisconsin average income with 14.9% of the population living below the Federal Poverty Line. The percentage of children in poverty is significantly higher than the state average (rank: 61 of 72) with 22% of children living in poverty and 38% of children eligible for free lunch program. Clark County is 95.9% white with a small but growing Hispanic population in the north eastern parts of the county. This number is still lower that the state of Wisconsin's average of 6.2% Hispanic population. The county shows its interesting diversity with the statistic it is ranked second in the state for percent (14.6) speaking language other than English at home just behind Milwaukee County. The other language is primarily German spoken in the Amish homes.Overall, Clark County residents face barriers to professional, quality care that other Wisconsinites do not. Brain health in children is also being recognized as a critical issue in our country. Research indicates that poor children are disproportionately exposed to factors that may impair brain development and affect cognitive, social, and emotional functioning. These risks include environmental toxins, inadequate nutrition, maternal depression, parental substance abuse, trauma and abuse, violent crime, divorce, low-quality child care, and decreased cognitive stimulation (stemming in part from exposure, in infancy, to a more restricted vocabulary).As of 2017 Clark County only had one psychiatrist for its 34,713 residents. Clark County has been designated as a mental health shortage area by the state of Wisconsin Health Department. Residents have also voiced concern. Clark County residents expressed their concern for mental health/behavioral health in the community health improvement planning process (CHIPP) where residents chose mental health as one of its priority areas of work. This is most relevant since farm stress and suicide rates have risen over the past few years as the farm economy has continued to suffer low profits due to issues outside of their control. This financial stress is felt throughout the family unit."|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0
192|Community Food System Program Support|"A Community Food System Team was launched in 2012 for two complementary reasons. First, Extension leadership saw it as a topic amenable to interdisciplinary work that might break down the ""silos"" dividing our four Program Areas at that time. Secondly, Extension staff statewide were responding to constituents who were passionate about solving food-related problems. Many understood that these problems had systemic causes, and that solutions required collaboration across boundaries delineating traditional academic disciplines as well as public vs. private entities; urban vs. rural communities; and those who have power from those who don't. Furthermore, the Team brought together colleagues who focused on different elements of the food supply chain: food production, processing, distribution, marketing, consumption, and waste management. Unfortunately, Extension's ""team"" structure has always had great limitations. Typically, team leaders volunteer their time in small, sporadic increments. There are usually no expectations or incentives for them to pursue external funding to support team programming. Without funds to support new products and activities, it can be difficult to keep colleagues, partners and constituents engaged. A notable exception was the Emerging Agricultural Markets (EAM) Team of the former ANRE Program Area, which garnered nearly $700,000 over ten years via a Senate appropriations process that is no longer tenable. The highly flexible funding attracted consistent participation from both ANRE and CNRED staff, plus specialists from DATCP's Marketing Division. The team trained 26 Agricultural Innovation Counselors; published a 135-page Guide for Direct Market Meat Producers and a 109-page Guide for Agricultural Entrepreneurs; sponsored an annual statewide conference; and supported a score of county-specific initiatives. Even with significant funds, EAM Team leaders often lacked the authority or status to engage with other institutional entities. The time they could give to team leadership was constrained by other duties. Leadership turnover also became a problem. These limitations have hampered other teams throughout Extension.The ""graduation"" from Team to Program offers tremendous potential for Community Food System programming. Having a dedicated Manager, with decision-making authority and outcome expectations, should provide the consistent leadership that has eluded the Team structure. As an official unit of Extension, the Program should enjoy opportunities to partner with other campus and external entities in grant proposals. Furthermore, if a needs assessment and/or strategic planning process is undertaken in 2019, and truly engages campus, county and regional Extension colleagues, it could articulate a concrete vision for CFS programming that will guide our collective work for years to come. Notes from two meetings at last December's Extension conference, and dozens of private conversations with colleagues over the past six months, are my evidence that this new Program is sorely needed and highly anticipated. I expect it will enjoy a period of generous participation by colleagues and external partners who have long seen the need for Extension to step up its role in developing food systems that more effectively meet the needs of people living and working in communities throughout Wisconsin."|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
193|4-H Food Smart Families |Multiple layers of wellness choices make up a healthy life - healthy eating habits, physical fitness, positive social interactions and relationships, a healthy and balanced inner life, and the avoidance of risky behaviors. Each of these layers is connected to and impacts the others. For young people, the ability to maintain a healthy life is further influenced by internal beliefs and personal practices as well as their environment - the community, school and home in which they live.  Acknowledging the interconnectedness of all layers of health to make up a healthy life, the Living Healthy Team operates in three primary areas:   Nutrition and physical activity - including fitness, nutrition, safety, sexual responsibility, general hygiene, and adequate sleep Social-emotional well-being - including youths' sense of confidence, self-efficacy, emotional regulation, self-reliance and optimism, empathy, connection, contribution, ability to lead a team, teamwork, appreciation of cultural diversity, and civic responsibility Furthermore, the nationwide mission mandate of 4-H Youth Development is to expand participation among youth and their families in the dynamic process of healthy living, so they are physically, socially, and emotionally prepared to meet the challenges of the 21st century.Nutrition & Physical ActivityNationally, in 2015, 13.9% of high school students were considered obese while an additional 16% were overweight, based on body mass index. More than 14% of high school students got less than 60 minutes of physical activity, with significantly higher rates of sedentary lifestyles among females (17.5%) than males (11.1%). Nearly half (45.6%) of high school students indicated they were trying to lose weight at the time of the survey. The rate is much higher (60.6% among females). Screen time is a significant factor. Time spent playing video games or on computers for more than 3 hours per day has increased to 41.7% in 2015, up from just 31% in 2011. Looking at nutrition, in 2015, during the 7 days before the survey was administered, 14% of high school students did not eat breakfast, 5% did not eat fruit or drink 100% fruit juice, and 7% did not eat vegetables. Since 2005, drinking of both milk and soda declined. However, in 2015, only 78.5% of high school students reported drinking milk and 73.8% reported drinking soda. The 2017 Wisconsin Youth Risk Behavior Survey shows that student rates in each of these areas are consistent with the national statistics. According to The Trust of America Health Project, in 2016 the combined overweight and obesity rate for children between the ages of 10 - 17 is 29.5%, raking 31 of the 50 states. (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, High School Youth Risk Behavior Survey (2015): https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/results.htm and Trust for Americas Health https://stateofobesity.org/states/wi)Finding ways to support healthy habits including good nutrition and physical activity starts at an early age. Young people in 4-H Youth Development programs explore a range of food choices and learn more about how exercise can help their bodies grow strong and healthy. Furthermore, older youth take on leadership roles in teaching about and advocating for healthy options. They become camp counselors and leaders in other programs where they can encourage younger children to live an active lifestyle.Pepin County has ranked in the top ten counties in the past 3 years on its health rankings, although has dropped in the past three years. In 2015 Pepin County ranked 2 out of the 72 counties in Wisconsin, and in 2016 ranked 5 out of 72. According to 2017 County Health Rankings data Pepin County ranks 8 out of the 72 counties, with an adult obesity rate of 34% compared to the state average of 31%. According to the State of Obesity report for Wisconsin the data for Pepin County between 25% and 30% of youth are overweight or obese compared to the WI child obesity rate of 22% According to the 2017 Health Ranking report for Pepin County, 26% of the county residents are physically inactive, compared to 20% statewide. 59% of Pepin County have access to exercise opportunities, compared to a Wisconsin rate of 81%. Diabetes rates in Pepin County are at 12% compared to the WI diabetes rate of 9.8%, that would be 470,136 cases in 2010 in Wisconsin. (State of Obesity report for Wisconsin)Physical Inactivity in Pepin County has increased from 2004 to 2014, from 21% to 26%. When that is compare to Wisconsin they are higher, Wisconsin which is 20% in 2004 to 21 % is in 2014. (University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute-Health Rankings)Positive youth development is a crucial element in developing life skills including communication, conflict resolution, and personal management as well as critical ways of being such as self-esteem, self-responsibility, and managing feelings. Youth development programming that intentionally builds confidence and competence in these life skills helps prepare young people to make healthier choices for themselves and their bodies|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1
194|Strengthening families raising children (2019)|"""Families are a cornerstone for raising responsible children who become caring, committed contributors in a strong democracy, and competent workers in a sound economy[1]."" In one statement, Karen Bogenschneider, former director of Wisconsin's Family Impact Seminars, summarizes decades of research about the significance of families in our American culture. The Center for Study of Social Policy[2] reports five research-based protective factors that lead to stronger families, optimal child development and reduced child abuse and neglect. These five protective factors are parenting knowledge and skills, social connectedness, parental resilience, concrete supports in times of need, and the social-emotional competence of parents and children. Families are not responsible to create or ensure these protective factors entirely on their own. The environment or community and societal context in which families exist also play a major role in strengthening families by promoting protective factors. This is supported by Bronfrenbrenner's ecological theory of human development[3] which outlines the impact of interpersonal primary relationships, connections between home and primary community settings (school, work, etc.), partnerships between and among community entities that support families, and the effects of many systems, policies and cultural or contextual factors. In addition, individual biological factors such as mental illness or chronic disease, and even temperamental traits, can influence how parents navigate their roles as manager, nurturer and child developer.Strengthening families who are raising children in Marquette County and Wisconsin is a core concern of Extension's Human Development and Relationships Institute. In Marquette County, key informant interviews affirm the need for Extension efforts to sustain existing parent education and support efforts and develop new ones as capacity allows. Parent leaders, parent program participants, and professionals working with parents increasingly look to Extension for parenting resources, information and education. Marquette County Human Services provides one full-time in-home parent mentor and one-half time community response worker. Marquette County Health Department offers well-baby visits. Head Start, the public schools and a few churches offer occasional educational programs. Childcaring, Inc. is the lead agency for Parent Cafs. These efforts, and Extension's efforts to strengthen families by addressing protective factors across the ecology of child development, constitute the sum total of parenting education resources in the county.The low-income nature of Marquette County and the rural, relatively isolated geographic location make it challenging to develop additional programs and services that would strengthen and support families, such as family resource centers, afterschool programs, mentoring programs, and home visitation. Marquette County has no hospital, limiting access to hospital-sponsored parenting programs to those who will travel out of county. Marquette County has no community foundation, no United Way, and no private foundations that award grants of $20,000 or more. To complicate this further, U.S. Census data indicate that the majority of Marquette County residents living in poverty are our younger population, including children and young adults in their developmental years, and adults bearing and raising children. Of our 1,362 households with children under age 18, 13-19% are living in poverty[4]. Poverty is major risk factor for child abuse and neglect and puts children at risk of achieving optimal development. Two hundred and two (202) grandparents are raising their grandchildren under age 18, largely due to parents' incarceration, mental illness or substance abuse disorders. Twenty-five (25) of these parents live under the poverty line[5]. The United Way of Wisconsin's 2016 ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, and Employed) report indicates that approximately 41% of Marquette County households struggle to afford the basic necessities of housing, healthcare, childcare, food, and transportation.[6] These include households that earn more than the Federal Poverty Level, but less than the basic cost of living for Marquette County.Because many basic parenting programs and supports would be missing in Marquette County without Extension, the situation must reflect the need for Extension to sustain existing efforts and look for ways to partner or fund new programs. Digital parenting educational resources are available, but Marquette County Extension's capacity to implement these are hampered by time constraints. Nevertheless, parent use of technology to access parenting resources is critical and will be addressed as time allows this year.[1] Bogenschneider, K.

195|Expanding Access (2019)|Demographically, the United States continues to grow more diverse and this demographic trend is even more apparent nationwide with the youth population (Chart 1).Chart 1 (Child Trends, 2016)Wisconsin's racial minority population increased 500 percent between 1970 and 2013 including significant increases in Latino/Hispanic, Black/African American and Asian populations (Gordon, 2016). Similarly, the growing number of foreign-born youth and families provide opportunities for 4-H youth development to grow its membership base and reach new audiences. In 1990, census figures showed the foreign-born population at about 121,500; in 2015, that number had increased to nearly 279,000. This represents an increase of 130% over the 25 year span (Long, Jones, & and Ewald, 2017). These audiences are historically underserved by 4-H Youth Development. Families and individuals may lack familiarity with 4-H (knowledge barrier) or unable to access 4-H programs by traditional means (organizational barrier). 4-H Youth Development can benefit by welcoming youth and volunteers from diverse backgrounds. As an organization, UW-Extension needs diversity in its staff, volunteers and learners to effectively participate in an intercultural and global world.The 4-H Community Club program had 29,912 youth (grades 5K-13) enrolled in 2017. Of those youth enrolled in 4-H Community Clubs, 94.7% identified as White (4-H Youth Development State Office, 2018). In 2017, 10,787 adults had been certified as 4-H Youth Development volunteers of those 97.1% of these adults self-identified as White (4-H Youth Development State Office, 2018). Given that Wisconsin's population is 86% White according to Census 2010, it is clear that the community club program does not reflect the state's demographic profile (United States Census Bureau, 2010).In addition to the 4-H Community Club, 4-H Youth Development in Wisconsin offers programs for youth that include 4-H Afterschool programs, in-school enrichment programs, and group educational experiences at camps, demonstrations, library programs and more. In 2017, 27,392 youth participated in these experiences across the state and 82.3% of these youth were identified as White (4-H Youth Development State Office, 2018). Although gains have been made in delivering educational programs to underserved youth through these types of modalities, more effort must be made to provide racially and ethnically diverse 4-H participants with all the opportunities available through 4-H club programs, including staff support, awards, educational trips and scholarships.In April of 2016, National 4-H launched a new campaign aimed at rebranding 4-H as a strategy to increase the number of ethnically and racially diverse youth participating in the program. National 4-H has set their goal high. By 2025, 4-H wants to add 4 million new members and in so doing double the number of African American and Hispanic youth engaged in the program. This goal is especially pertinent in Wisconsin where the state's youth of color face extreme racial disparity across all measures of well-being and could benefit greatly from quality youth development programs. According to the 2016 KIDS COUNT Data Book, Wisconsin ranked 12th among the 50 states in overall child well-being, but persistent challenges hinder children living in immigrant families and children of color, especially African-American, Latinx and American Indian children (The Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2018; Kids Forward, 2018). Black children and American Indian children in Wisconsin are more than four times as likely to live in poverty as White non-Hispanic children, and Hispanic children are nearly three times as likely as White children (Kids Forward, 2018). In 2015, a 24/7 Wall Street Special Report listed Wisconsin as the worst state in the nation for Black Americans. Authors citied home ownership, unemployment, and incarceration rates as key indicators of extreme racial inequality (Frohlich, Sauter, & Stebbins, 2015).According to a 2002 study conducted at the Institute for Applied Research in Youth Development, Tufts University, researchers discovered that compared to their peers, youth involved in 4-H programs excel in several areas. Adapting what works in 4-H Youth Development programming to the needs of emerging and underserved audiences is a major goal of the Expanding Access Team. We know from recent focus groups conducted with diverse stakeholders that parents are interested in these programs and willing to assist with programming in their communities. In April 2017, 4-H Youth Development was reviewed for Civil Rights Compliance by a team from NIFA-USDA (Hicks, 2017). The review was conducted to determine whether UWEX was complying with the provisions of the U.S. Civil Rights law and USDA's Civil Rights rules and regulations. The team found significant areas of improvement. Serious civil rights concerns include:  the ability to collect participant data inequitable access to participate in activities and opportunities supporting a diverse and inclusive volunteer base the absence of a strategic plan for expanding access the lack of a diverse and demographically representative advisory groupIn Washburn County, about half of the students in public schools are economically disadvantaged. Over half of the students in Washburn County school districts have been economically disadvantaged at least three of the last five years (Northwood School District) or four of the last five years in the other three districts (Department of Public Instruction WiseDash School District Data, 2018). Race and ethnicity data show that the number of non-white students has grown over the last five years in each district, while there are fewer total white students in all but the Shell Lake school district. Of non-white students in the public schools, youth of Hispanic descent are the most prevalent with 68 (3%) accounted for in the most recent data, and American Indians are the second most prevalent with 48 (2%.) 120 students (5%) in the county are two or more races. Employees with the St. Croix tribe have indicated that not all youth with Native American descent are accounted for in this data because the tribe requires a person to be 1/8 blood quantum to claim Native American ancestry. There are students that report that they are fully white because of this. There is also a larger population of Native Americans (24%) in the Hayward School District; while Hayward schools are located in neighboring Sawyer County, the school district services also Washburn County youth. Looking at the traditional 4-H Community Clubs, two youth identify as Asian, one identifies as Hispanic, two identify as two or more races, and three are unreported, of 103 youth registered for 4-H clubs in 2017-2018 . 3/36 adults chose not to identify their race and the rest were white. The community clubs program doesn't represent the growing diversity of race and ethnicity that Washburn County has.|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1

Some of the most common food borne illnesses include E.Coli, Salmonella, Listeria and Norovirus. Statewide tracking and reporting systems, such as the Wisconsin Public Health Profiles, have information on communicable disease, including food borne illness, by county. According to the most recent profile (2017), Salmonellosis and Campylobacter enteritis were the most commonly reported food borne illnesses in Fond du Lac County. Food borne illnesses are primarily prevented through proper hand washing, food handling and preparation and food storage.|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0
198|Increasing Community Youth Development in 2019|Dane County is home to a growing diverse population that faces many challenges. Between 2000 and 2010, the county's total African American population increased by almost 50%. The 2013 Race to Equity Report outlined drastic disparities between segments of the county's population. For example, 74% of Dane County's children of color were poor, compared to 5.5% of white children. Dane County's juvenile justice numbers also show disparities that are wider than those found elsewhere in the state or nation. Teens of color in Dane County are six times more likely to be arrested than whites. Similar disparities apply to many other statistics including academic performance, unemployment, and health rates between residents of color and white residents. Dane County is also home to a large segment of Wisconsin's Hispanic population that has increased by 127.8% from 2000 to 2015. Spanish-speaking residents also face many socioeconomic disparities related to lack of services opportunities provided in their primary language.Dane County UW-Extension is uniquely situated to engage in programming to support underserve Dane County's residents. Many local organizations rely on UW-Extension's partnership for access to direct education, community connections, and other resources to carry out programs that reach underserved populations. It is likely that UW-Extension will make a difference to address racial disparities due to its track record of partnering with organizations to carry out programming year after year. By creating capacity for local organizations to provide programming to the community, UW-Extension extends its impact in the community to provide educational programs to underserved populations.|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0
199|Financial Security Programming (2019)|In 2014, University of Wisconsin-Extension gathered feedback from Oconto County community members by executing a Family Living visioning process. The top critical needs identified and challenges facing Oconto County residents include; economic uncertainty, poverty and underemployment. The objective of financial security begins with establishing stability, or ability for a family to make ends meet. For many families and individuals, just one shift in the flow of financial resources (e.g., loss of job, death of spouse, divorce, or chronic illness) can lead to significant negative financial suffering. Evidence that there is a need for financial education programs to improve financial capability sills is shown in Wisconsin based on the 2015 FINRA Financial Capability Survey, which collected data from people in each state to measure financial behaviors, attitudes and knowledge (See http://www.usfinancialcapability.org/results.php?region=WI).  47% find it very/somewhat difficult to cover expenses and pay billso 51% do not have 3-month emergency savingso 28% pay the minimum due on credit cardso 21% have past due medical billso 16% spent more than earned over past yearThese statistics suggest there is ongoing financial insecurity in the state, potentially signaling the need for supportive educational programing. However, Wisconsin is not alone in this respect, in general people in this state reflect regional and national trends. Family Financial Security programming will help people to improve their financial management capability. This will enhance the financial security of families in the state, which will benefit communities by boosting economic stability and contributing to a foundation for economic growth.|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0
200|2019 Menominee Health & Wellbeing|"The coterminous boundary of Menominee County/Reservation delineates 235,000 acres total, 233,000 of these acres in trust status. 217,000 acres are in commercially forested lands - the majority of which is under sustainable forestry management practices. It is home to four unincorporated rural communities, to include Native Americans and non-native residents who live on fee land. Flowing wildly through Menominee land, the Wolf River is known for its waterfalls and pristine waters. Lakes and wetlands are integral to the landscape. Menominee is rich with the Native tradition of respect for the land.The population of Menominee County is approximately 4,615 according to the 2018 US Census QuickFacts. 82.4% is Native American, 11.7% White, .9% African American, 2.6 Asian, and 2.5% Two or more races. Although this is a relatively small population, there is an abundance of needs in the community that can be addressed through UW-Extension Family Living Programs. Traditionally, family and social organization is very important in the Menominee culture. Children are considered to be gifts and are cherished as such. Elders in the Native American community are valued for their wisdom and are often given a place of honor in ceremonies and community gatherings. They hold the aspects of the culture within them and are the teachers of the ""old ways"", including speaking and teaching traditional Menominee language. Situation 1: Unfortunately, there are other factors at play within the Menominee County/Nation community, including startling health statistics - 39% of births for which the mothers smoked during pregnancy, the impact of ACE's (Adverse Childhood Experiences) and historic trauma with an estimate from the Menominee Indian School District of many youth having an ACE score of 7 or higher, alarming levels of alcohol and drug abuse, 36% of adults smoking (Z-score was capped at -3.0/3.0 due to population <20,000), 43% of adults obese, and teen pregnancy (highest teen birth rate at 101 per 1,000 births). These and other statistics have led to Menominee County consistently ranking 72nd out of 72 counties in overall health outcomes (University of Wisconsin's Public Health Institute).This educator and the 4-H Youth Development Educator held a series of Talking Circles in 2018 to discover what parents and caregivers felt their greatest needs were. Talking Circles are a local practice that is used to share, get ideas, and solve problems openly. Trends emerged through these talking circles - parents and grandparents need support in parenting strategies and coping with the stress of parenting, caregivers and youth need support in the area of social-emotional health, youth need additional opportunities for safe physical activity and recreation, families need opportunities to learn and play together to support family relationships, alcohol and other drug abuse are a serious community issue, and youth need to learn Menominee language and culture. UW-Extension is uniquely poised to address many of these issues through health related and family relationship programming."|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0
201|Financial Security Programming (2019)|"The 2017 estimated population of Grant County is 51,999 people, with 96.5% being white, 1.4% Hispanic, and 1.4% black. It has a slightly higher percentage of people aged 65 and older (15.6%) than Wisconsin as a whole and a lower percentage under 18 (21.3%) as compared to Wisconsin as a whole (23.6%). It is a rural county with a population density of 43 people per square mile and experienced a minimal (0.42%) growth rate in the last decade. Grant County has a poverty rate of 15.4%, higher than the 12.5% state average. The medium household income is $49,067, which is well below the national average of $56,516. The child poverty rate is 17%, also higher than the Wisconsin rate of 16%. In Grant County, the proportion of the population receiving FoodShare increased from 2.8% in 2000 to 14.7% in 2015. In Grant County during the same period, the share of school-age children certified for free or reduced price meals grew from 27% to 45%. These economic statistics along with priority issues determined by Grant County UW-Extension needs assessment completed in 2015/16 has assisted in setting a framework for the Grant County Family Living Program.In 2015-2016 Grant County UW Extension partnered with the Survey Research Center (SRC) at the University of Wisconsin at River Falls to conduct a county wide needs assessment. Programming priorities on topics related to the family are more evenly distributed than for any of the other Extension programming areas. There are no clear top priorities for family-focused programming, but the overall average level of importance attached to these topics was higher than all other Extension programming areas. There several topics that about half or more of the respondents felt were very important: personal finances (saving/investing for the future, budgets, debt, credit reports, etc.), child development, identity theft, caring for aging family members, healthy lifestyles (nutrition, physical activity, social and emotional health), coping with family transitions, communication and relationship building. In a comparison with the 2015/16 needs assessment over previous efforts ranked a higher awareness or concern in regards to health & well-being over parenting practices gathered from open ended questioning as noted in the following bullet points.  Discuss and plan how to deal with incursion of drugs, gangs, and crime in Grant County.   Expand substance abuse programs possibly through the court system.  Mental illness treatment for Grant County residents.   Programming for healthy living, lifestyle behavior change, and healthy decision making.  Promotion of health of all aspects i.e. food, physical, mental, relationship, etc.  Find out why cancer is so prevalent in this county.  Healthy lifestyles.After careful consideration of priorities and needs of Grant County, the determined priority program efforts will focus on building community capacity supporting and building family financial security and economic well-being, building family strengths, improving parenting supports and practices, and promoting healthy lifestyles while strengthening the collaborative efforts of all agencies serving families improving outcomes for children, families and society.The profound influence of families on society makes evident the importance of supporting and strengthening families. Issues' relating to parenting or the strengthening of families is nothing new for Grant County UW Extension, but often takes on new forms as parenting issues change with the times. Whether looking at families seeking basic parenting skills, support and prevention of AODA issues or child abuse, families struggling with divorce, couple relationships, connecting to community, or spending quality time together; citizens of Grant County are concerned about families enduring ongoing challenges that remain a fact of life. It is also apparent within Grant County that even though families remain the primary place where children are raised there is increasing evidence that the task is shared by others, and that ""care giving is everyone's business.""Program Priority #1As highlighted in the Family Financial Security State Team Plan of Work financial security is the goal for many Americans. Financial security is defined as an individual's or family's ability to meet short-term needs and to prepare for the future. The path to financial security requires accessible and accurate information, as well as financial competency in setting goals, earning, spending, saving, borrowing, and protecting. But it is not enough to just provide learners access to these concepts. Families would benefit from an increased ability to manage cash and credit so that they may not only make ends meet day to day, but also begin to set aside resources for emergencies and to reach future goals. However, access to financial education and information is still limited for many households. In addition, many seminars provided by financial services are not affordable for low- to moderate-income families and individuals, nor do they provide objective unbiased information. While about half of Wisconsin schools offer personal finance, most do not require it and few adults graduated at a time when schools offered such programs. Evidence that there is a need for financial capability skills is shown in Wisconsin based on the 2015 Financial Capability Survey from the FINRA Foundation. Beyond efforts in public schools, families critically need support during ""teachable moments"" such as when starting a new job, taking out a loan, buying a house, or beginning retirement. This is continually communicated throughout Grant County Family Living Agents communications across the county with parents, teachers and agency partners. Many wanting an easy one time fix, however as noted in the state plan of work, one recent report highlights the limited impact of financial education on increasing positive financial behaviors, while suggesting financial coaching as an approach to increase behavior change. Grant County Family Living Educator has incorporated financial coaching techniques working with learners in order to facilitate self-guided learning resulting in increased personal awareness and positive financial capability behaviors. More work needs to be done to refine how to access Grant County consumers during these key times and to develop better forms of delivering information for various audiences. Over the years the Grant County UW Extension Family Living has successfully partnered with organizations across the county leading to building financial capacity as a way to improve their household financial management capability enhancing their personal financial security benefiting communities by boosting economic stability contributing to a foundation for economic growth.One standing partnership includes a tri county planning team of 11 School Districts (Belmont, Benton, Cuba City, Fennimore, Highland, Iowa Grant, Lancaster, Mineral Point, Platteville, Potosi, Southwestern) in the annual SWIFLE Event (Southwest Wisconsin Financial Literacy Event). This interactive event involves youth participating in accounting, financial literacy, etc. courses in the 2018/19 school year in the above mentioned schools. Over 60 volunteers are utilized at the individual stations from choices on housing, purchasing a car, groceries, paying child care, utilities, investments, etc. - the volunteers keep it real making it fun and interactive. The event allows youth to get a glimpse at what lies ahead in the ""real world."" UW Extension Family Living Agent's role at this time is the continued yearly planning partnership, assisting in updating station sheets, attaining volunteers, and facilitating the event.Other partnerships and referrals include the Work n Wheels program through SWCAP & Head Start, Department of Social Services Wisconsin Home Energy Association Program (WHEAP), Family Promise of Grant County, Inc., the Grant County OWI/Drug Court, Unified Community Services, Grant County Taskforce on Homelessness, as well as individual referrals. Financial coaching skills are strategically utilized and the online UW Extension Financial Building Blocks Money Matters as part of the new pilot group under increasing individual credit worthiness - https://fyi.uwex.edu/moneymatters was newly incorporated in the fall of 2017."|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0

203|Early Learning and School Readiness (2019)|"The need for this project is demonstrated by data compiled by the Kindergarten Readiness Network (KRN) of Higher Expectations for Racine County Youth. The Network maintains a dashboard of the PALS (Phonological Awareness Literacy Screener) to determine the number of children enrolled in RUSD's 4K program who meet or exceed spring literacy benchmarks.According to Wisconsin DPI, ""Wisconsin teachers use PALS to identify students at risk of developing reading difficulties, diagnose students' knowledge of literacy fundamentals, monitor progress, and plan instruction that targets students' needs."" Based on the findings, not all students are coming in ready for kindergarten - both academically and social-emotionally.In the spring 2016-17 school year, approximately 68% (1,015) of all RUSD 4K students entered kindergarten ready to learn. Wide disparities of literacy achievement existed based on race/ethnicity and income level. For example, 85% of White, non-Hispanic students met the literacy benchmark compared to only 49% of African American/Black students and 57% of Hispanic students.

As a result, the Network is looking at ways to improve kindergarten readiness in RUSD so that 98% of 5K students enter kindergarten ready to learn."|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0
204|Kemam?ceqtaq:  We are all moving|The County Health Rankings and Roadmaps rank Menominee County as the least healthy county in the State of Wisconsin. This tool ranks length of life, quality of life, health behaviors, clinical care, social & economic factors, and physical environment for all 72 counties in Wisconsin. The following variables show the community and health disparities in Menominee County as compared to the State of Wisconsin according the 2018 County Health Rankings and Roadmap:Variable Menominee County Ranking Wisconsin Ranking Premature death 15,000 6,000 Adult obesity 45% 31% Children in poverty 41% 16% Access to exercise opportunities 2% 86% These rankings have impacted the community positively as they have created a sense of urgency. Service providers are motivated by the rankings and with help from the University of Wisconsin Madison, created the Menominee Wellness Initiative. The Menominee Wellness Initiative is a partnership between local service providers and UW-Madison and the group uses a collective impact approach to addressing the need. Language, culture, and traditional food systems are increasingly being recognized as a different approach to overall wellness. In response to work that is being accomplished by the Menominee Wellness Initiative, UW-Extension applied for and received a Center for Disease Control grant that focuses on local systems changes to address obesity. This innovative grant provides support for addressing the built environment, policy changes, and the creation of a food hub within Menominee County and the Menominee Indian Reservation. The grant addresses work that the Menominee Wellness Initiative has been discussing and has not had the resources to address. This educator's work will focus on specific outcomes of this grant for the next five years.|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0
205|Dairy / Livestock & Farm Management Programming (2019)|St. Croix County continues to attract Twin Cities residents in pursuit of the rural lifestyle. Most own small acreages and work off the farm. Demand for information on beef, sheep, goat, and other livestock enterprises is growing with these small farms. These livestock enterprises also complement cash grain enterprises, and are transition enterprises for exiting dairy farms. Per the 2012 Census of Agriculture, St. Croix County is home to 353 beef farms, representing over 6,000 head (updated census data expected in 2019). Close proximity to the Twin Cities offers direct marketing opportunities, but also creates challenges in legally crossing state lines with product. Many of these smaller enterprises, and non-dairy enterprises, do not draw as significant interest from private agri-business. This dynamic can create more demand from Extension to support these enterprises. Dairy continues to be an important sector of the local ag economy. A prolonged downturn in dairy prices has placed significant financial pressure on local dairy farms. Wisconsin Ag Statistics service reports indicate St. Croix County lost on average one dairy farm per month in 2018. Challenges with the quality of feed harvested in 2018, particularly corn silage, is reducing daily milk production at this time. Many new rural landowners don't know what ag enterprise they want to pursue, and do not know the harsh realities of the farm business. As the agricultural landscape changes in St. Croix County flexibility will be needed to address emerging farm financial management issues, such as land rent and enterprise budgeting. Farm management concepts often times require one-on-one teaching efforts. With an aging farm operator population, more producers are looking for information on farm succession planning and/or exit strategies during challenging financial times. As St. Croix County experiences continued urban development, urban / rural conflicts will increase. At this time allowable land uses (ag vs. housing, agri-tourism is not permissible in much of the county) and water quality are the leading issues. Forage production and grazing are closely related production topics for animal agriculture. These are topics I intend to continue being involved in, although not necessarily as a primary program affiliation.|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
206|Youth Leadership in Ashland County 2019|According to Michael Delli Carpini of the Pew Foundation, in the past three decades, two thirds of our American 18-25 year olds do not even vote (excepting the last 3 presidential elections). Carpini argues that habits of citizenship and civic engagement develop early in life, and are hard to change later on. The danger of this is that a disengaged youth becomes a disengaged adult. Thus, a thirty year decline in civic engagement bodes ill for our local and our national community. Locally, this trend manifests itself in aging boards and councils. In addition, a majority of seats in our local elections go uncontested. In order to counter the trend pointed out above, in accordance to UW-Extension and 4-H youth development goals, and in response to the wishes of the Ashland County Ag and Extension committee and community leaders, it is imperative that Ashland County youth be given opportunities and encouragement to develop public leadership skills and experience. UW-Extension Youth Development and 4-H have echoed both the concerns and the importance of focusing on youth leadership development among other top priorities for educational programming. Since 2006, Ashland County UW-Extension 4-H Youth Development has developed and implemented the following programs to provide leadership development and opportunities for local youth to lead:  Teen Court Program Superior Days Legislative forum in Madison School-based leadership training program (3-12th grade, longitudinal, average 3 program contacts per year for 345 students in the Ashland School District)  4-H Ambassadors leadership training program, including leadership training for volunteer camp counselors at 4-H Summer Camp, a 4-H Winter Camp, and other programs including opportunities to run workshops for younger students and opportunities to speak to 21 grade school classes each spring.This is just a sample of leadership development programs that have been put into place during my tenure as the Ashland County 4-H Youth Development Educator. This past year I added planning for, supporting and guest teaching in a full-year, 1 credit high school leadership class at Ashland High School. The need for the class was determined by a group of concerned school administrators, teachers, coaches, and community leaders (including UW-Extension) who met for 18 months to explore the need and establish an educational response. The planning and execution of the class includes teaching the skills outlined in the 4-H life skills model for leadership development, and opportunities to practice leadership taken from the new Illinois leadership competencies model. UW-Extensions role has become more important in local youth leadership development as school budgets have shrunk over the past 8 years and many or most of the district based leadership development opportunities have fallen by the wayside due to budget cuts.|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0

Pop-Up Nature is a brand new program model that we developed and piloted in 2018. This program was designed to be a drop-in program meant for busy families that still wanted a nature experience. Each Pop-Up Nature is a two hour experience which includes a seasonal-themed hike, hands-on activities, and personal interaction with a staff naturalist. To make Pop-Up Nature more accessible in 2019 it will be offered in five additional park locations.|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

This is based on the position listening session that was held with key stakeholders for the CRD position here in the county. Juneau County has seen phenomenal changes in key economic indicators in the past 8-10 years in the area of lower unemployment, higher per capita incomes, and in new job creation. In the past the county has had unemployment figures as high as 13-14%, as compared to the current rates of less than 3%. The continuation of business counseling, starting a business classes, assisting in business financing with banks or RLFs funds, and strategic planning for businesses and organizations continue to be key areas of work for the CRD position within the county.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
210|AIS Prevention Network|The UWEX ERC AIS Program helps coordinate the work of the larger Wisconsin AIS Partnership, a group of ~75 professionals that work on AIS issues across the state. In late 2016 it was announced that the DNR grant program that funds many of these partners was going to change - instead of fewer larger, competitive grants, the program would shift to more contracts for smaller amounts. This will hopefully provide consistent AIS services across Wisconsin and reduce the patchiness that was previously seen under the competitive grants program. This new program is currently called the AIS Prevention Network.UWEX is in a position to help provide consistent training to AIS Prevention Network and to help existing AIS partners work across jurisdictional boundaries to implement a consistent program. In areas where this is no program, UWEX could provide AIS Prevention Network services.|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
211|Family Financial Security (2019)|The number of Green Lake County residents estimated to be living in poverty is 12%. The median household income of the county is at $50,276. The combination of these two data sets contributes to an increased number of 'working poor' in the county. Green Lake County residents are suffering from a higher than [state of Wisconsin] average rate of unemployment (5.0%). Unemployment has been shown to increase unhealthy behaviors related to alcohol and tobacco consumption, diet, and physical activity. In the last eight years, there has been an increase in children living in poverty in Green Lake County (15% to 19%). The Green Lake County Agriculture, Extension Education, & Fair Committee has expressed a high need for financial literacy education within Green Lake County. The needs arises, as students are not receiving this type of education during their schooling, which creates a cycle of generations who do not know how to manage their money or budget properly. Often times, financial instability can have broad health impacts, including increased risk of mortality, poor health, and increased cardiovascular disease risks.|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0
212|Human Development & Relationships Programming (2019)|Families perform a variety of key functions that contribute to both the mental and physical health of individuals as well as the public health and functioning of society. Throughout all developmental stages, from the prenatal period to the last years of life, strong healthy relationships help families effectively and efficiently raise healthy children, care for vulnerable members, and sustain productive workers and contributing community members.Children who are born into and raised in an environment of positive relationships have a strong foundation that can help them develop into healthy adults and productive citizens. This environment of relationships involves not only parents and children but also extended family and social networks, schools and childcare providers, and others who engage with the family. Stable, nurturing relationships have a powerful protective impact on children. They help prevent exposure to multiple risks and stressors, including family violence and neglect, parental incarceration, and mental illness. Exposure to these stressors is associated with numerous poor outcomes, some of which are commonly seen across multiple generations within families and are very costly to society. In addition to contributing to prevention, safe, stable, nurturing relationships with parents and other caregivers serve as a buffer to help mitigate the damaging impacts of toxic stress. Healthy relationships help children thrive. Adult health and well-being also depend in great part on the quality and success of relationships. Adults in stable relationships have better health outcomes, greater financially stability, a greater sense of well-being and improved capacity to provide care for vulnerable family members, including children and older adults. It has long been understood that a strong parent/child relationship is a key factor in preventing negative outcomes for children. More recent research suggests that strong relationships between parents and other adults, including romantic partners, friends and extended family, can help prevent child maltreatment and improve the capacity of adults to parent effectively. Healthy relationships help adults nurture.|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0

214|Economic Data for Local Development|Many of the towns, villages, and cities in St. Croix and Polk Counties are struggling to attract and retain young families and qualified workers. This has become very apparent from discussions and work done by economic development organizations in the region (e.g. Momentum West, St Croix EDC, Pierce Co. EDC, Polk Co EDC, Chambers of Commerce, and education institutions. This presents a two-sided problem: 1) have accurate and timely information to effectively market a location, and 2) have the right information and data to diagnose and correct local problems related to economic development goals. While several data dashboards exist that focus on socio-economic data, I have seen few that do it with an explicit purpose in mind and none that interpret the data in a meaningful way. This program aims to rectify this problem. It will draw upon similar existing programs in Extension services in other states, different data guidelines form various EDOs, and internal knowledge and expertise within UW Extension. The output will be an education program that will teach local economic developers, government leaders, and businesses learn about sources of data, interpretation of data, and effective use of data. In addition, this education program will aim to produce regular education materials that focus on various topics related to economic development which maybe use in newspaper articles, teaching events, or marketing campaigns. The outcome will be local municipalities that can better understand and manage their situations to become more prosperous and experience desired growth.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
215|Family Economic Security and Financial Literacy|"Financial security is the goal for many Americans. Financial security is defined as an individual's or family's ability to meet short-term needs and to prepare for the future. The path to financial security requires accessible and accurate information, as well as financial competency in setting goals, earning, spending, saving, borrowing, and protecting. But it is not enough to just provide learners access to these concepts. The long run objective of financial security begins with establishing financial stability, or the ability to make ends meet. For many families and individuals, just one shift in the flow of financial resources (e.g., loss of a job, death of a breadwinner, divorce, or long-term illness) can be detrimental to financial stability and, if persistent, will impact financial security. These shocks to resources can be the impetus for significant negative financial outcomes including, in some severe circumstances, personal bankruptcy. Families would benefit from an increased ability to manage cash and credit so that they may not only make ends meet day to day, but also begin to set aside resources for emergencies and to reach future goals. However, access to financial education and information is still limited for many households. In addition, many seminars provided by financial services are not affordable for low- to moderate-income families and individuals, nor do they provide objective unbiased information. While about half of Wisconsin schools offer personal finance, most do not require it and few adults graduated at a time when schools offered such programs. Evidence that there is a need for financial capability skills is shown in Wisconsin based on the 2015 Financial Capability Survey from the FINRA Foundation.Beyond efforts in public schools, families critically need support during ""teachable moments"" There is a shortage of objective financial education on cash and credit management and risk management. One recent report highlights the limited impact of financial education on increasing positive financial behaviors, while suggesting financial coaching as an approach to increase behavior change.[1] UW-Extension financial educators are encouraged to use financial coaching techniques with learners in order to facilitate self-guided learning resulting in increased personal awareness and positive financial capability behaviors. Barron County stakeholders have identified theses teachable moments and the lack of financial education and success. Participants working through the drug court program are required to get a job and for many this is the first time they have held a job that was needed to support their families. Along with Drug Court incarcerated individuals have also been identified as an opportunity to provide financial education and change. Without my engagement in this education these programs would be lacking financial education. In many cases these are under served audiences and my involvement allows education to those who might not otherwise seek it out.The current need for financial supports in the state is evidenced by the 2015 FINRA Financial Capability Survey, which collected data from people in each state to measure financial behaviors, attitudes and knowledge (See http://www.usfinancialcapability.org/results.php?region=WI).  47% find it very/somewhat difficult to cover expenses and pay bills 51% do not have 3-month emergency savings 28% pay the minimum due on credit cards 21% have past due medical bills 16% spent more than earned over past yearThese statistics suggest there is ongoing financial insecurity in the state, potentially signaling the need for supportive educational programming. Wisconsin is not alone in this regard; in general, people in this state reflect regional and national trends."|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0
216|ATOD and Social-Emotional Health (2019)|"Multiple layers of wellness choices make up a healthy life - healthy eating habits, physical fitness, positive social interactions and relationships, a healthy and balanced inner life, and the avoidance of risky behaviors. Each of these layers is connected to and impacts the others. For young people, the ability to maintain a healthy life is further influenced by internal beliefs and personal practices as well as their environment - the community, school and home in which they live. Acknowledging the interconnectedness of all layers of health to make up a healthy life, the Living Healthy Team operates in three primary areas:  Nutrition and physical activity - including fitness, nutrition, safety, sexual responsibility, general hygiene, and adequate sleep Social-emotional well-being - including youths' sense of confidence, self-efficacy, emotional regulation, self-reliance and optimism, empathy, connection, contribution, ability to lead a team, teamwork, appreciation of cultural diversity, and civic responsibility  Prevention of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs (ATOD) Furthermore, the nationwide mission mandate of 4-H Youth Development is to expand participation among youth and their families in the dynamic process of healthy living, so they are physically, socially, and emotionally prepared to met the challenges of the 21st century.Social-Emotional HealthSuicide is the 2nd leading cause of death for young people ages 10-24[1] and the national suicide rate among all ages has been rising for more than a decade. For every suicide death in Wisconsin, there are 11 hospitalizations or emergency department visits for self-inflicted injuries. Wisconsin's teen and young adult population have the highest rates for self-inflicted injury.[2] Statistics like these point to low social and emotional wellness among young people. A further concern is that many of the counties with the highest suicide rates coincide with those having the highest numbers of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs).[3] Many of those counties are rural as well, just one of many indicators of a growing rural health disparity.According to the 2017 Wisconsin Youth Risk Behavior Survey,[4] reports of electronic bullying are increasing - 16.6% in 2011 to 18.4% in 2017. Likewise, 27% of high school students reported feeling sad or hopeless for more than 2 weeks in a row, up from a low of 20.4% in 2009. Nearly 1 in 5 (17%) high school students reported having hurt themselves purposely without wanting to die, self-harm being a coping strategy for many young people who don't have other, healthier strategies available to them.Alcohol, Tobacco and Other DrugsChallenges with high ACE scores and poor mental health have a significant impact on the choices young people make around alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. According to the Wisconsin Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), the smoking rate has decreased from 29% in 2005 to 11% in 2017. Similarly, the rate of marijuana use has also decreased from 7% in 2005 to 5% in 2017. However, a growing trend is the use of electronic vapor products, which was at 11% in 2017. Similarly, youth rates of alcohol use has decreased overall, but the early age of onset (having their first drink of alcohol other than a few sips before age 13) increased from 14.6% in 2013 to 15.5% in 2017, the first increase since 1999. Youth rates of prescription drug misuse - an important precursor to use of street drugs like heroin - have also decreased; yet 1 in 10 youth report having taken prescription pain medications differently than the doctor's recommendation. While the use of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs in Wisconsin is reportedly decreasing, trends within these statistics must be addressed. Local Situation StatementIn Buffalo County the local situation is similar to that of the state and national data. A developmental situational analysis conducted in UW-Madison's Division of Extension Area 9 (Buffalo, Jackson, Pepin and Trempealeau Counties) yielded a top priority for mental health and drugs (particularly opioids and meth). These findings mirror those that contributed to a 2017 Comprehensive Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) in Buffalo County focusing on increasing mental health screenings and trainings for QPR and mental health first aid. In addition Buffalo County's newer developed Criminal Justice Services Department and Coordinating Council have placed increased emphasis on the connections between mental health, addition and recidivism; introducing more opportunities for restorative justice measures with the adult population. Buffalo County school districts also received mental health grants in 2018-2019 academic year to focus on trauma-informed education, including mindfulness, social emotional learning and wrap-around services. Moreover, in 2018, an estimated 25% of youth enrolled in summer programming in Buffalo County in 2017 had at least one adverse childhood experience with the top ACE's being drug addition, neglect, poverty and witnessing family violence. There has also been a reported uptick in self-harm with elementary and middle school youth and an increase in students seeking school psychologists (all of which are contracted services at schools in Buffalo County).The data from the aggregated Buffalo County 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey for both middle school and high school illustrate a growing need for mental health services and use of meth and opioids among students. Buffalo County UW-Extension, Law Enforcement, Social Workers and their coalition have contributed to the kNOw Meth campaign in 2018 and plan to expand resources and educational experiences in 2019. The extent of meth use in Buffalo County has more than quadrupled in the last three years and there has been an evidenced increase in child neglect and child placements in foster care as result of meth use in Buffalo County. The prevalence led the department of Human services to hire two new social workers in 2018 and The use of e-cigarettes among young people has also risen significantly nationally and in Buffalo County. A student survey of vaping/juuling use indicated that nearly 75% of middle and high school students know a friend that vapes. The number of vaping teen court referrals rose from zero in 2017 to fourteen in 2018. There has been a direct ask for Buffalo County Extension Educator to work in collaboration to tackle what the CDC has labeled as an ""epidemic.""Similarly, local school administration and human services have sought out the expertise of Buffalo County Extension Educators in digital photo sharing and social media safety. As ""sexting"" has implications for young people as a risk behavior that significantly contributes to mental health, this continues to be an area of concern and programming in Buffalo County.

217|Addressing AIS Pathways|Wisconsin is shifting its AIS program to focus on invasion pathways as opposed to individual species. This shift will help identify how AIS are moving into and throughout the state while helping the WI AIS Partnership develop actions to reduce the number propagules in transport. Historically, AIS programs have spent most of their effort addressing the recreational boater pathway and have spent some effort addressing organism in trade (OIT) pathways. This shift in focus should allow Wisconsin to address and close previously unaddressed pathways.Addressing pathways involves a lot of applied research combined with partnership building and collaboration. These are all things that UWEX is in a strong position to help facilitate.|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
218|Inclusive Engagement with Local Government (2019)|"In the Spring of 2018, County Board Chair Sharon Corrigan assembled a team of supervisors and staff to develop a plan of action to guide the County Board's efforts in inclusive engagement. The initiative is called ""Engage Dane"". The goal of Engage Dane is to put in place a variety of approaches for regular and inclusive engagement across the continuum from awareness to partnership. County government is responsible for many and diverse services, including public safety, human services, lake management, planning, and transportation. County Board members must be conversant in both a variety and a changing range of issues. EngageDane will provide fact sheets with background information to share with constituents at meetings or via newsletters or social media. County Board members will also be trained in inclusive engagement, and provided with resources to use inclusive engagement strategies. The 2019 inclusive engagement plan is to focus on select issues and develop skills and practices in inclusive engagement: a) County jail, b) Youth Justice, c) Lake Levels/Flooding, d) Biogas, e) Human services (Department highlight), f) Water Quality/nutrient management. Extension Dane County (2 Educators - Sharon Lezberg & Mindy Habecker) have been involved in the development of the initiative and drafting the initial report and toolkit worksheets. We will continue to be engaged in the pilot project implementation throughout 2019. The role that this educator will play in the initiative is detailed under action plan."|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
219|Iron County Non-motorized Trail Development (2019)|Historically in Iron County, a northern county bordering Lake Superior and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, the most popular forms of outdoor recreation included motorized and sportsman activities. Today the Iron County Department of Forestry hires a trail coordinator as well as two recreations maintenance staff, and collectively their primary responsibilities are maintaining motorized trails and county parks. However, in recent years the Forestry Department has shown some interest in non-motorized trails, the first project being a set of groomed trails near a county park. This development occurs alongside the establishment of a nonprofit group called the Iron County Outdoor Recreation Enthusiasts (ICORE) which serves to promote silent sport activities and opportunities throughout Iron County. Infrastructure projects require significant amounts of time and energy, and involve multiple years and partners to achieve outputs. With the development of Michigan's statewide non-motorized Iron Belle Trail just outside the eastern edge of Iron County, the City of Hurley aims to extend this non-motorized trail through its downtown and westward into the neighboring City of Montreal. There is also a set of non-motorized trails in the City of Montreal that is in need of new leadership and maintenance as of January 2019. Extension Iron County has an opportunity to support these developments by facilitating necessary processes, connecting and recruiting engaged stakeholders, and building general community awareness on the benefits and possibilities of non-motorized trail development in the Iron County area.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
220|Coastal Training Program 2019|The Coastal Training Program is dedicated to providing opportunities for local decision-makers to learn about the factors that influence coastal systems, think critically about the role that they play in coastal management, and cultivate skills and confidence that will allow them to be intentional about taking actions that result in mindful management of our estuaries and Western Lake Superior coast. In alignment with Reserve priority issues, CTP is broadly supportive of coastal programming around habitat and water quality, climate change adaptation, land and development impacts on water, and enhancing connection to coastal places and spaces. Program development for CTP is driven in part by opportunistic partnerships, but core program themes are thoughtfully guided by needs assessment work and Reserve priorities, which are reflected in the program's Strategic Plan, the Reserve Management Plan, and various NOAA reporting metrics. A gap analysis of programs was conducted as part of the 2012-2016 needs assessment and a survey of programmatic and informational needs was administered to the target audience in March 2017. This needs assessment work has provided a baseline for the program's topical focus areas, delivery methods, and an understanding of participant motivations.The findings of the 2017 survey revealed that decision-maker stakeholders are most concerned about climate change impacts, adaptation and resilience; water quality issues; overdevelopment of shorelines and habitat; erosion; and invasive species. They also identified financial constraints, organizational capacity, and social and cultural resistance to change as the largest barriers to making progress on coastal community issues in their work. Professional development opportunities that address how to work with the public to create behavioral changes, how to incorporate scientific research into policy development, and how to access data, graphics and information were of highest interest to respondents. The most convenient training formats are online courses, webinars, demonstration programs and field trips, and seminars. Expert speakers, networking opportunities, informational materials, and certification are the most effective incentives for encouraging participation.|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
221|Financial Security Programming (2019)|"According to the ALICE report compiled by United Way (https://www.uwiw.org/sites/uwiw.org/files/ALICE%20Report%20Wisconsin.pdf), 15 % of Walworth Counties residences were living in poverty and 29% are considered ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed). The report breaks down a bare-minimum budget (without savings) that would be needed to survive in Walworth County. For a single person to survive in Walworth County, the person would need to make $25,968. This is far above the $11,670 that is allowed to be considered at the Federal Poverty Level. A family of 4 (two adults, one preschooler and one infant) would need to make $58,836 to survive in Walworth County. Again this is far above the Federal Poverty Level budget of $23,850. In addition, economic conditions were ranked in three core areas with an index of 1 (worse) to 100 (best). Walworth County Ranked in the ""poor"" category for each of these conditions: housing affordability (score of 30), job opportunity (score of 50) and community resources (score of 38). Walworth County residence understand that without a good knowledge of basic financial capability many of these families are not able to meet basic needs. In February 2015, Walworth County UW-Extension worked with UW-River Falls to conduct a needs assessment. Eight of the top ten issues were the same in the public respondents and volunteer/client respondents, albeit in a somewhat different order. Both groups identified issues related to economic wellbeing (financial skills, job training/development, workforce readiness), family issues (cyberbullying, family financial management) and personal well-being (fitness, outdoor activities, emotional health). The #1 rated item by the public and volunteer/client respondents was financial skills for the future. Family financial management was rated at #7 by public and #8 for volunteer/client respondents. Among the ""Home and Family Issue"" questions, the number one rated issues was family financial management, the fourth was affordable housing (rated 28 by the public and 35 by volunteer/client respondents overall) and the seventh was landlord/tenant relations (rated 47 by the public and 52 by volunteer/client respondents overall).Our financial security team's plan of work has outlined the importance of financial security for families. Financial security is defined as an individual's or family's ability to meet short-term needs and to prepare for the future. The path to financial security requires accessible and accurate information, as well as financial competency in setting goals, earning, spending, saving, borrowing, and protecting. But it is not enough to just provide learners access to these concepts. The FFS Team promotes financial capability more broadly, which includes how learners apply what knowledge they have combined with access to financial products and services, prior experiences, attitudes and behaviors. (See Figure 1)Families would benefit from an increased ability to manage cash and credit so that they may not only make ends meet day to day, but also begin to set aside resources for emergencies and to reach future goals. However, access to financial education and information is still limited for many households. In addition, many seminars provided by financial services are not affordable for low- to moderate-income families and individuals, nor do they provide objective unbiased information. While about half of Wisconsin schools offer personal finance, most do not require it and few adults graduated at a time when schools offered such programs. Evidence that there is a need for financial capability skills is shown in Wisconsin based on the 2015 Financial Capability Survey from the FINRA Foundation. Figure 1: FINANCIAL CAPABILITY MODEL Beyond efforts in public schools,families critically need support during ""teachable moments"" such as whenstarting a new job, taking out a loan, buying a house, or beginning retirement.There is a shortage of objective financial education on cash and creditmanagement and risk management. One recent report highlights the limited impactof financial education on increasing positive financial behaviors, whilesuggesting financial coaching as an approach to increase behavior change.[1]UW-Extension financial educators are encouraged to use financial coachingtechniques with learners in order to facilitate self-guided learning resultingin increased personal awareness and positive financial capability behaviors.More work needs to be done to refine how to access consumers during these keytimes and to develop better forms of delivering information for variousaudiences throughout urban and rural areas in Wisconsin.[1] Fernandes, Daniel, John Lynch, and Richard Netemeyer.

222|Volunteer Development 2019|"Adult volunteers are Wisconsin 4-H's most valuable asset in delivering the quality youth-led, adult guided programs to support youth as they acquire essential life skills. Wisconsin 4-H Youth Development has over 10,500 volunteers who are enrolled as UW-Extension 4-H volunteers working with 30,000 youth enrolled in 4-H programs. In 2017, volunteers reported on average they donated over 54 hours per year. Approximately 70% of Wisconsin 4-H volunteers are female and 30% are male. Nationally, women continue to volunteer at a higher rate than men. (Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. Department of Labor.) In Wisconsin 4-H, approximately 97% of the volunteers are white. WI 4-H Youth Development volunteers currently do not reflect the demographics of most counties.Locally, Brown County is home to a total of 17 active 4-H Community Clubs, making 4-H a strong part of the fabric of the community. Total enrollment, in both traditional and special interest clubs throughout the county, in 2017-18 over 1,100 youth, with 60% of the members participating in community clubs. Aside from community club programming significant programming began to be offered in 2013 in an additional area: school enrichment /afterschool programming, STEM Saturday programming and summer camps. In 2017-18, more than 480 students participated in 4-H programming in the afterschool/out of school time programming. In 2018, Brown County had 169 youth and adult volunteers. Brown County demographics indicate there is a potential audience of volunteers who reflect significant and multiple racial and ethnic groups who are currently not volunteering in 4-H Youth Development (ES-237 Data, 2013-14). In Brown County, the volunteer-to-member ratio is 1:15. Without the valuable contributions of volunteers, the 4-H Youth Development program simply would not exist.As programming options for Brown County 4-H Youth Development have expanded, so have the needs to recruit, retain and engage volunteers in different capacities. Brown County 4-H Youth Development brought on new volunteers to engage in community clubs, but also hired part time, limited term employees to be the liaison between 4-H Youth Development and the 4-H Afterschool program, with employees being trained in youth development and afterschool curriculum, and them being the face of the afterschool program. Taking a new and fresh look at Youth Development, specifically in an urban setting, various levels of adult involvement and staffing patters are required. 4-H Youth Development, however, is not the only organization in Brown County that relies on local volunteers to develop and implement programming. With over hundreds of non-profit, tax exempt organizations throughout the county, volunteers are in high demand. Moreover, qualified and trained volunteers are increasingly important. The face of the volunteer is changing, as well. Volunteers in the past were long-term volunteers, many of whom helped to start the programs they volunteer in. The world of volunteering has changes in the past 10 years, and to remain competitive, organizations need to adjust the way they recruit, train and manage volunteers. As reported by the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics (2015), volunteer participation rates nationwide have declined steadily over time, showing only 24.9% of adults indicate they are volunteering. That is nearly 1 percentage points since 2013, leaving This is the lowest volunteer rate reported since the survey and data were collected, beginning in 2002. In addition, the research shows that men are less likely to volunteer (21.8%) versus women (27.8%)Thus, the demand on volunteers in any program have shifted and become more taxing and demanding. To fully address the needs of current volunteers, organizations, including UW-Extension and 4-H Youth Development, need to provide adequate training, support and materials to allow volunteers the ability to fulfill their changing expectations and demands. In addition, organizations must adjust recruitment strategies and techniques to appeal to the shorter-term, busy volunteers that are willing to help, but not necessarily commit one's life to an organization. Research by Thomas McKey, a published author on volunteerism, indicates that volunteers in the 21st century demand flexibility, the use of technology and competence. In addition, volunteers are busy and want to be assured that by taking time out of their schedule will not just make a contribution, rather, will make a difference.The value of volunteers is recognized throughout Wisconsin, the nation and internationally. When organizations consider the economic value of a volunteer, the time donated by volunteers is astronomical. The dollar value of a volunteer hour in Wisconsin is $24.69 (Independent Sector, Value of Volunteer Time, 2018). If a typical volunteer donates 50 hours per year to an organization (many of them donate many more hours), the value of time given to Brown County 4-H Youth Development is nearly $208,630 annually. As the program success of 4-H Youth Development program depends on the building and maintenance of volunteers, time and effort need to be dedicated to volunteer recruitment, development, training and support. As detailed in the 2008 National Learning Priorities: Volunteer Development for the Next Generation Knowledge and Skill Rubric and Syllabus paper (Pleskac et al, 2008), ""building the individual capacity for volunteerism in paid staff will lead to increase organizational capacity"". In addition, ""educating and empowering volunteers to assume or accept service or volunteer roles will help improve and build volunteer capacity and competencies"" (2008). The philosophy of volunteer and staff development can be seen in practices throughout Wisconsin 4-H, including professional development opportunities for staff, volunteer leader training and development, and statewide volunteer forums for education, support and recognition of 4-H Youth Development volunteers. However, it is also noted that the amount of time staff actually has and dedicated to volunteer development and management is less than it should be to be most effective and prepared for the needs of volunteers. Volunteers play a critical role in the delivery of quality educational programs. In a survey completed January 2015, 4-H Youth Development staff identified Volunteer Development as an area in need of program support. Additionally, a WI 4-H Youth Development Survey was conducted in February 2014 of over 1500 volunteers. Adult volunteers in 4-H indicated relatively low awareness and understanding of some of the educational principles (Essential Elements and the Experiential Learning Process) that are central to the work of 4-H Youth Development. In the 2014 survey, volunteers expressed an interest in learning through not only face-to-face modalities; but also through online-learning such as webinars and podcasts. The 2017 Strategic Plan released by USDA NIFA and National 4-H Council outlines a 4-H Youth Development Vision for 2025. Nationally the following goal has been established ""Youth are surrounded with competent, prepared staff and volunteers."" This goal includes the following outcomes:""The 4-H program is supported by a well-trained volunteer force.""""4-H staff and volunteers engage in meaningful professional development.""In addition, there is a responsibility of volunteers to ensure access, equity and opportunity. The National 4-H Strategic goal states ""All youth engage in program and opportunities."" To that end it has been identified that ""4-H volunteers and staff are skilled, knowledgeable and prepared to work with all members of their community."" Youth experiences in an organization are directly affected by adult leader relationships and expectations. As non-profit organizations, and to ensure they are fulfilling the mission of Wisconsin 4-H Youth Development, and effectively be a catalyst for positive community youth development, organizations should be welcoming, inviting environments where learning and growing can occur. To strengthen the effectiveness of volunteers throughout Brown County, volunteers must be confident and well-equipped with essential tools, resources, and knowledge to teach and lead activities that strengthen the youth development experience (Wisconsin 4-H Volunteer Leader Development, 2008)"|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1

In 2019, I will continue pursuing the work plan that we submitted as part of our designation. Part of this research agenda is detailed under my major program titled: ""Addressing Labor Force Quantity and Quality in Wisconsin."" Another major component of this work plan includes addressing the need for understanding regional industry concentrations and diversity. This research component is based on the demand from regional economic development organizations (EDOs) and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) in researching opportunities and challenges related to industry clusters. Specifically, WEDC and regional EDOs all base components of their economic development strategies on understanding how they can assist specific categories of industries to become more successful and sustainable. As with labor force issues, we can address this need using our research capacity and educational programs."|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

Four Talking Circles were held with 19 participants in various locations on the reservation with 5 mothers, 2 non-mothers, and 12 grandmothers. 4-H Youth Development Educator and UWEX colleagues discovered the following themes regarding inter-generational families who are active members in the Menominee 4-H Clubs on the reservation and local community members:  Need for Cultural Programming - traditional Native American arts & crafts, storytelling, songs, dances Youth leadership opportunities   Addressing trauma and bullying through Native healing practices   Sustain Menominee 4-H through fundraisers and promotional events   Provide opportunities for low-cost physical activities with active parent engagement- sports, tournaments, revitalizing swimming and park areas Promote family based activities - Outdoor movie nights in the park and game nights Address transportation barriers with low-income families   Partner with local organizations to support 4-H Find ways to address negative issues facing the Menominee community - AODA, DV, homelessness, young mothers|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1
226|Nitrogen Use Efficiency Field Trials and Educational Workshops |Discovery Farms established its nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) Project in 2015, and from 2015-2017, we collected NUE data from over 50 participating farms across six regions of WI. Through this time, we refined field methodology and results messaging while working with farmers and their corn production practices. This process provided participants with individualized insights into how corn nitrogen (N) management can be altered to achieve economically efficient yields while reducing N losses to the environment. Additionally, over time, this project accumulated enough data to create WI NUE benchmarks, which are now used so that farmers can assess how their individual NUE values compare to those in WI and determine how they can improve their NUE.The goal of the NUE Project is to transform NUE into an effective and viable self-evaluation tool of nitrogen management for farmers, crop consultants, advisors and other agricultural and water specialists. One way to accomplish this was to partner with local extension and natural resources agencies to teach them the NUE field trial methodology and monitor NUE with partnering farmers. In 2018, Discovery Farms began a three year-long partnership with local agency in Sauk, Pepin and Dunn counties for NUE monitoring. These NUE field trials will continue into 2019. Additionally, the NUE project is launching an NUE workshop series, which will be held in 4-6 locations throughout WI. These workshops are designed to train farmers, crop consultants and advisors on how to implement NUE self-evaluations on their fields, analyze their results and determine future management decisions. The workshop series serves both as a research and an educational tool, as it will facilitate the collection of more NUE data which will add to Discovery Farms' NUE dataset to make benchmarks more representative and accurate, and will share important findings related to NUE and N management with our target audience.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

Nationally, women continue to volunteer at a higher rate than men. (Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. Department of Labor.) In Wisconsin 4-H, approximately 97% of the volunteers are white. WI 4-H Youth Development volunteers currently do not reflect the demographics of most counties.In 2018, Waushara County had 105 adult volunteers. The demographics of volunteers were 63% female and 37% male with approximately 98% of the volunteers being white. The largest Waushara County racial/ethnic groups are white 89.8% followed by Hispanic 6.2% and black 1.5%. The ethnic Hispanic group and the racial black present in Waushara County indicate there is a potential audience of volunteers who are currently not volunteering in 4-H Youth Development.

229|Financially Secure Individuals and Families|"The FLE will continue to focus on financial capability in families this upcoming year. Access to financial education and information is still limited for many households.The support for such programming began the fall of 2013, where a Visioning Session was held to identify community-based issues in Waupaca County. The category, ""Family Financial"", received the most number of ""high priority"" votes. In the 2013 Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP), there was identified need for ""free or affordable classes for families with limited resources"" such as classes on budgeting, checkbook balancing, and other classes related to long-term financial security. It was also indicated that ""limited education has been provided by UW-Extension"". The rationale behind the interest in financial security was in part drawn from the 2017 County Health Ranking's data, taking into consideration variables that can affect families and individuals' abilities to make ends meet: 1) percentage of children in single-parent households (245%), 2) percentage of population with at least some college education (55%), and 3) living in a county with an unemployment rate that matches the country average (4.1%). All these factors influence income-earning potential Family Living state teams in Extension have strong financial programming that continues to evolve to fit consumer needs. In Waupaca County, there are no other organizations that offer financial education for the general public. Thus, the FLE can offer many opportunities for community members."|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0

231|Addressing Rural Workforce Development 2019 |"During the course of 2018 I sought to engage business owners for feedback in Forest and Vilas Counties as often as I could. Coordinating with the Vilas County Economic Development Director, I conducted 23 business retention visits in eastern Vilas County as a follow up to the survey of 150 businesses that I had done in 2017. I engaged economic development boards of both Vilas and Forest County - including directors, board members and business people as often as possible to gather input on their thoughts about business and economic development. I helped a private citizen - along with a small team - to prepare and hold an event we collectively called the Northwoods Forum, which attracted 88 people, to discuss economic development issues common to Forest, Vilas and Oneida Counties. From all of these gatherings and 'listening sessions' of the people in the region, two major topics emerged that I feel I can contribute much to the region by addressing: workforce development and broadband. The importance of the workforce issue was captured in the statewide Situational Analysis conducted in 2018 by UW-Extension. The desperation felt in rural areas on this issue can best be summed up by the comment of one local business that I visited in Vilas County in 2018. In operation for decades, the owners stated {with the critical problem of not being able to find help in the area}: ""this is the issue that is going to put us out of business."" Some businesses have cut back on their hours, thus reducing profitability while potential workers remain home, unemployed and in some cases, using opioids. Thus, a serious disconnect exists in our area. Researching Best Practices in Rural Workforce Development is Major Program #1."|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
232|Addressing Affordable Housing Needs (2019)|"Regional Housing Challenges in Bayfield and Ashland CountyLack of adequate housing is a persistent and growing challenge across Bayfield and Ashland counties. Regionally, there is a lack of emergency housing and transitional housing. The strain on current emergency and transitional housing services and providers has been exacerbated by a burgeoning methamphetamine and opioid crisis.There is also a lack of adequate housing to address seasonal workforce needs. This is of particular concern in area of the counties that rely heavily on tourism, including the popular tourist destinations of Bayfield and LaPointe. Businesses report spending time each year seeking out staff housing and an inability to hire employees based on lack of housing options, further exacerbating the growing workforce challenges. Some businesses have begun to purchase employee housing. This practice is not ideal, as it is reported to be risky for the business owner and removes much needed housing stock form the year-round market. In addition to affecting the hospitality, retail and recreation markets, lack of housing is also creating a challenge for regional farms. Migrant and seasonal workers are employed to harvest fruit crops and support regional dairy farms, but adequate housing is not available, resulting in poor living conditions for these vulnerable workers and economic loss to farmers. There is a reported need in both Ashland and Bayfield Counties for more low-income and median-income housing. Housing insecurity is a significant problem, with many residents under the mean income contributing more than 30% of their resources to housing. Recent efforts to develop a mixed-income housing development in the Bayfield County seat of Washburn (including some low-income and permanently affordable units) were thwarted by NIMBYism and a pervasive prejudice against low-income persons, despite the reality that the vast majority of the community would qualify for these units. Further exacerbating the housing problem, Bayfield County reports over 50% second home ownership county-wide. This drives home values out of reach for median income home-buyers, and simultaneously removes quality housing stock no longer serving year-round residents. It should be noted that there are several luxury homes in the region, many concentrated along the lakeshore of Bayfield and Ashland County. The purchase price of these homes, and the incomes of the homeowners, skews data upward and makes data analysis of the problem more challenging.There is a reported lack of quality housing stock. Much of the housing stock is old and quite expensive to maintain and repair. Many of these homes have fallen into disrepair, creating risk for buyers and increasing overall housing insecurity. The large majority of the homes in the region are large single family homes, in need of significant structural and mechanical upgrades. Regional storms and flooding exacerbates these challenges, with common defects in foundations causing basements flood with regularity. There are some programs for homeowners to make upgrades to homes, but homeowners often fall outside the income guidelines or lack sufficient home-equity to access these funds.There is a reported lack of quality rental units in the region. This is particularly challenging for younger and low-income residents and exacerbates the problem of attracting and maintaining younger people in the community. Lack of rental units also forces residents to purchase homes before it is economically sound, or to purchase low-quality, high-risk properties, leading to further housing insecurity. There is some anecdotal evidence that housing co-ops may provide residents with an alternative opportunity to build equity, while simultaneously making use of some of the larger houses on the market. However there is lack of information on these solutions and no local examples of such arrangements or data that points to interest.There is also a lack of homes that can adequately serve the needs of aging populations. Bayfield County is expected to be the ""oldest county"" in Wisconsin by 2035, with over 40% of residents over 65. There is insufficient housing options to receive these residents interested in downsizing or looking for semi-assisted or maintenance free housing options.Programs to support the development of low and middle-income housing units are few and far between. In a traditional development model, developers apply for tax credits to offset the cost of providing units as below market rates. These tax credits are competitive and size of development (number of units) are core criteria for evaluation. Because of the rural nature of Bayfield County, no one community can absorb a ""competitively sized"" development (<60 units), rendering these sized-based incentive programs difficult to access for rural communities. There is also a lack of data to understand the scope of the regional housing problem. Anecdotally, housing is considered a significant issue, but few studies have been done to quantify the problem, and none have been performed at a regional scale in the past decade or more."|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
233|Civic Education and Personal Development|"This area of emphasis focuses on youth cultivating the habits and skills necessary for political participation in a democratic society and taking individual and collective action to identify and address issues of public concern. The ideal in a democratic society is that citizens are actively involved in their own governance and that such participation is based on an informed and critical reflection of political and civic issues (Branson & Quigley, 1998). Therefore, the success of such a system is built on a citizenship that is civically engaged and informed. There is, however, much debate over the balance of civic knowledge, civic skills and civic action. The debate is not pertaining to the importance of these three elements, rather which of these are vital in defining one who is ""civically engaged.""Many reports express concerns regarding the levels of civic engagement and knowledge in the U.S.. In particular, adolescents' and young adults' knowledge of and engagement in the civic process are below desirable levels (Coley & Sum, 2012). The link between civic engagement and knowledge on the one hand, and political participation on the other, has resulted in a widely documented decline in the political participation of young Americans. There has been a steady decline in voting participation in young adults between 18 and 29 between 1972 and 2014 with only 45% of young adults voting in the 2012 presidential election and only 21.5% voting in the 2014 midterm election (""Center for Information on Civic Learning"", n.d.).In addition to a general concern with engagement, knowledge, and participation, some scholars have placed particular emphasis on what has been termed the civic empowerment gap (Levinson, 2010) which describes an inequity among social groups in terms of their political participation and influence. More privileged groups typically have more political voice than other groups. Among those groups that are historically and currently underrepresented in the political process are those with low income and less education (Coley & Sum, 2012) as well as recent immigrants and those with limited English proficiency (Kahne & Sporte, 2008). This empowerment gap is reflected in the civic knowledge of traditionally oppressed groups. Black, Hispanic, and Native American students perform significantly lower than their White peers on assessments of civic education (U.S. Department of Education, 2010).4-H Youth Development prioritizes learning by doing to maximize positive youth development outcomes. Successful strategies include: building youth/adult partnership practices into community decision-making, whether within the 4-H organization or in other community settings, from community coalitions to organizational boards and committees. Resources to inform these practices can be found at https://fyi.uwex.edu/youthadultpartnership/  facilitating action planning processes, by which youth can address community issues, either in youth-led spaces with adult coaching or in partnerships with adults working on the same issues. Resources for action planning have been developed for the Tech Changemakers program (https://fyi.uwex.edu/wi4hcitizenship/research-resources/) and the FoodWIse/4-H Youth Development Youth Action for Community Health project) creating opportunities for youth input and decision-making including Teen Courts where youth enact restorative justice, opportunities for youth to serve as advisors on local government boards (Youth in Governance), etc. where they can build relationships with and inform adult decision-makers, youth input into community development through participation in planning process, etc. These opportunities help youth to build understanding of community issues and their civic roles.Youth who participate in these types of opportunities develop habits that make civic participation as adults much more likely. In Wisconsin, we have also seen evidence that youth develop an appreciation for the communities where they live and develop supportive relationships with community adults. Outcomes for communities of youth civic engagement include greater economic and social development that includes young people in all aspects of community life. Key practices developed by the Engaging Young People to Sustain Communities include empowering more diverse community leadership, increasing social capital, and strengthening sense of community and sense of place (see, for example, https://blogs.ces.uwex.edu/engaging-youth/files/2015/02/EYP-White-Paper-February-2015.pdf). These outcomes are particularly important for groups that are marginalized from community leadership due to race, class, or other characteristics.In 2005 a Youth Risk Behavior Survey was completed with all 7th, 9th and 11th grade students within Sheboygan County in Public School Districts. The survey was repeated again in 2007 with the majority of Plymouth School Districts Students grade 6-12. The survey includes 60-100 questions regarding risk taking behaviors of youth. In addition to the Youth Risk Behavior Assessment, most youth also responded to several questions related to the presence of the 40 Developmental Assets in their lives and among their communities. The results reflected a limited sense of belonging felt by young people in relation to their schools and communities. Results also reflected youth not feeling valued by their communities. In a 2009 study, Civic Measurement Models: Tapping Adolescents' Civic Engagement, several measures of youth civic engagement were captured. These measures tap aspects of adolescent civic behaviors, opinions, knowledge, and dispositions. While the work was focused primarily on measures to capture adolescent civic engagement one response indicated that only 63% of youth felt they were likely to work with a group to solve a problem in the community where they live post high school. In 2018 Sheboygan, Wisconsin rated number 2 on the AARP Livability Index for livability based on housing, neighborhood, transportation, environment, health, engagement and opportunity. Sheboygan got high marks for civic engagement for its voting record: 71.8 percent voted, compared with the national median of 55.6 percent.According to the release, the city promotes civic engagement with numerous neighborhood associations, arts and culture ""and plenty of natural trails and parks for those who love to be outdoors."" Because of the local needs identified, a key focus of the 4-H Youth Development Educator, according to the Position Description is to provide opportunities for youth to assume leadership roles and responsibilities through group membership, community engagement and increased social capital."|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0
234|Healthy Living (2019)|"Green Lake County is a rural county in east central Wisconsin with a population of 18,760. The county spans over 349 square miles and is comprised of a variety of ethnic descendants, including Amish communities, that contribute to a unique mixture of cultures and customs. The population is predominately White and non-Hispanic, and the largest ""minority"" group is Hispanic at 4.9%, or approximately 919 people. Green Lake County residents are obese (37%), and lack engagement in physical activity (25%). Green Lake County residents also have insufficient fruit and vegetable consumption (77.1%). About 14% have reported being in poor or fair health, which is closely compared to the state average of 15%. Adult residents of Green Lake County have reported an average of 3.5 days (of the past 30 days), as physically unhealthy days. Even more days (3.6 days) were reported for poor mental health days in 2018. In Green Lake County, 10% of the adult population reported having frequent physical distress, meaning more than 14 days of poor physical health per month. Finally, 11% of the adult population was reported having frequent mental distress, meaning more than 14 days of poor mental health per month. There are high rates of diabetes (12%) and cancer (415 per 100,000) in Green Lake County. In some cases, both of these chronic diseases are preventable."|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0
235|People of Color Entrepreneurship Discussion Group|"From EDA WIndicator publication, ""...Compared to other parts of the U.S., the share of businesses that are minority-owned seems to be relatively modest in Wisconsin, and those businesses tend to be clustered in a handful of counties in southeastern Wisconsin. Similar to the U.S., minority-owned businesses tend to be smaller than their non-minority owned counterparts. But the absolute growth in the number of minority owned businesses over the past few decades suggest that the minority populations may be a fertile ground for the fostering of entrepreneurial activity. The challenge facing Wisconsin and local communities, is that many of current, and potential, minority business owners have unique social and business networks that areoften independent of mainstream networks. The research on social capital and entrepreneurship is clear; the broader the business owner's network (social and business) the more likely the business is to (1) start and (2) succeed. Parallel to the research on women business owners outlined above, a robust local business climate that fosters successful entrepreneurship must be inclusive to maximize thosenetworks. Because minority business owners, much like women business owners, operate in smallernetworks, attempts to broaden those networks is a necessary first step in building on the entrepreneurial potential of the growing minority population in Wisconsin.

236|Promoting health through physical education.|"The World Health Organization considers health a fundamental human right and defines it as ""a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."" Leading organizations and scholars agree that to make long-term sustained impact on health outcomes, policy, systems, environmental, and structural changes need to be made on the root causes and social determinants of well-being, in addition to evidence-informed direct education with individuals and families.A variety of factors contribute to the health of Florence County residents. According to the County Health Rankings (2018), Florence County ranks 21 of 72 for heath behaviors with a higher than state average for physical inactivity at 24% compared to 21% and adult obesity at 33% compared to the state at 31%. Including adult smoking at 15% and access to exercise opportunities lower than the state average at 73% compared to 86%. Florence County ranks 24th in the state for physical environment with 92% driving alone to work compared to 81% for the state. There is no reported data on mental health providers in Florence County. As of late 2018, Florence County was excited to welcome a mental health provider. According to the Census Population Estimates, Florence County has 4,456 permanent residents. With a racial and ethnic makeup as follows: 99.7% white, 0.3% two or more races, 0.3% black or African American, 0.9% Hispanic or Latino and 0.3% American Indian and Alaska Native. The median age of Florence County is 52.1. Because of the high aging population, it is a priority of Florence County to offer programming to the aging population.Another factor for additional programming and resources for the aging population is that Florence County only has one public gym available to its citizens. There gym is 24 hours but is often unsupervised which deters the elderly from attending. The citizens live in a rural area, making travel difficult to access workout and health facilities. There are plenty of hiking trails and outdoor amenities that are attractive to younger people. Our aging population would have a more difficult time utilizing these outdoor resources."|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0
237|Building Protective Factors and Resilience in Families (2019)|"Buffalo and Pepin are adjacent, rural counties and share a combined total of a little more than 20,500 individuals living in 8,759 households (U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts estimates, July 1, 2016), spread across 1,004 square miles. In both counties, agricultural-related activity is the primary economic base. Statistics show that family composition is mixed, with a greater percentage of single-parent households, unmarried parents and stepfamilies, in comparison to two-parent households. (American Community Survey Profile Report: 2011-2015 5-year estimates). Racial/ethnic composition in Buffalo County is 97.7% white alone; Pepin 98.2%. Although a relatively small percentage, Latino is the predominant minority, and I have utilized partnerships for outreach to connect with Latina-led young families for parenting and relationship education. Alcohol abuse, illegal drug use and mental health are top concerns for residents across both counties. (Great Rivers United Way COMPASS NOW 2015 Survey; Buffalo County Community Needs Assessment, 2015; Pepin County Community Health Improvement Plan 2016-2020; Buffalo County Community Health Improvement Plan 2016-2020). According to the National Provider Identification Registry, there were no mental health care providers available in Buffalo County prior to 2015. There are now two part-time mental health providers available in Buffalo and Pepin counties, with a patient to provider ratio of 6,679:1, compared with the WI state average ideal patient to provider ratio of 623:1. The lack of access to mental health services is a problem for families and individuals.Both Buffalo and Pepin counties face a dramatic doubling (from 15% to 30%) of residents age 65 and older by the year 2035. A need to prepare aging-friendly communities has been expressed among local government and agency partners, and will be a part of future programming planning. (This may become a secondary programming priority).Median household income is $50,196 and $49,516 for Buffalo and Pepin counties respectively. However, there are wide disparities between age groups, ranging from $16,917 for younger adults to $63,182 for seniors (U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts estimates, July 1, 2016). And, while unemployment rates are low, so are high-paying ""living wage"" jobs (livingwage.mit.edu, living wage calculator, 2017). Only 4% of Buffalo County respondents rated the availability of jobs with wages that offer a good standard of living; 74% responded poor or fair (2015 United Way: Buffalo County Random Household Survey). The percentage of high-paying jobs is low and a high household income is not enjoyed by most residents. The UW-Extension 2018 Developmental Situational Analysis process for Area 9 identified AODA and health concerns, and building skills for healthy family relationships, stability and well-being as two of the top five priority needs. This was based on a broad representation of stakeholder/partner input and surveys, and is consistent with results of a 2010 formal Survey of Issues and Themes Impacting WI Families and Communities that I conducted with local partners, as part of a statewide Family Living Program effort. Responses from dozens of partners confirmed my programming focus on education and prevention for family relationships and financial security, especially for vulnerable populations. Local Community Health Improvement Plans, United Way Community Assessments and Youth Risk Behavior Survey data continue to validate these programming priorities.I hold a leadership role within the Institute for Human Development and Relationships by chairing two state efforts: Healthy Relationships, and Correctional Systems Audiences. In order to make the greatest impacts at the local, regional or state levels, it is important that I leverage resources and be clear about my facilitating, research, education, planning and evaluation roles. Where possible, a prevention approach that reached a wide audience has been the foundation of programming efforts and, when necessary or appropriate, intervention strategies have been used. I rely on research and specialist support, as well as multiple sources for assessing current and future community needs. I advance a collective impact with partners and coalitions.Provide educational resources and opportunities about healthy couple, co-parenting and other family relationships parenting, child development, either direct education or contacts, online or through key partners."|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
238|Financial Capability Programming (2019)|"The current need for financial supports in the state is evidenced by the 2015 FINRA Financial Capability Survey, which collected data from people in each state to measure financial behaviors, attitudes and knowledge (See http://www.usfinancialcapability.org/results.php?region=WI).  53% answered 3 or fewer questions out of 5 on a financial literacy quiz 47% find it very/somewhat difficult to cover expenses and pay bills 51% do not have 3-month emergency savings 28% pay the minimum due on credit cards 21% have past due medical bills 16% spent more than earned over past year 38% reported their spending broke even 44% of women and 33% of men are able to come up with $2000 for an emergencyThese statistics suggest there is ongoing financial insecurity in the state, potentially signaling the need for supportive educational programing. Wisconsin is not alone in this regard; in general, people in this state reflect regional and national trendsLooking at use of financial products and credit, close to 1 in 10 people in Wisconsin do not have a traditional bank account. About 1 in 5 people have used payday loans, pawn loans, or similar high cost borrowing methods in the last year. About three-quarters of people have a credit card, but 28% pay the minimum due each month, incurring regular interest charges. As many as 1 in 5 people in the FINRA survey have paid credit card late fees in the last year. Clearly credit management and access to financial services remains an issue.Finally, the FINRA data offer some insights into the knowledge and application of knowledge by consumers in Wisconsin. People in Wisconsin performed slightly better than regional or national averages, but still show room for improvement. Notably, the majority of consumers in the state are not actively shopping for credit or monitoring their credit reports.Beyond efforts in public schools, families critically need support during ""teachable moments"" such as when starting a new job, taking out a loan, buying a house, filing taxes, or beginning retirement. There is a shortage of objective financial education on cash and credit management and risk management. More work needs to be done to refine how to access consumers during these key times and to develop better forms of delivering information for various audiences throughout urban and rural areas in Wisconsin.Financial programming will help people to improve their financial management capability. This will enhance the financial security of families in the state, which will benefit communities by boosting economic stability and contributing to a foundation for economic growth.The United Way has identified, with assistance from UW-Extension, the needs of the ALICE population in the county. ALICE is an acronym that stands for Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed. ALICE households earn more than the official U.S. poverty level but less than the basic cost of living. In Washington County, 28.6% of the population is ALICE while 5.6% of the population is at or below the poverty level. According to the Household Minimal Survival Budget researched by United Way, it takes $66,384 for a family of two adults, one infant and one toddler to meet their most basic needs in Washington County. This estimate includes the minimal cost of housing, child care, food, transportation and health care. People who struggle to meet these five basic needs will face difficulty in obtaining and maintaining employment, staying healthy and remaining self-sufficient. According to a basic needs survey conducted by the Greater Milwaukee Foundation in the fall of 2012, there were 13,645 FoodShare recipients in Washington County. FoodShare participation in Washington County had increased. Many students in the county that attend public schools receive free or reduced price lunch. For example, in the West Bend School District, 34.2% of the students were eligible in 2012.Over the past few years, several national organizations - the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Corporation for Enterprise Development (CFED) - released various guides for incorporating financial education into human service programs. UW-Extension Family Living Programs also has Wisconsin-specific training materials being used statewide by several educators. In mid-2016, new standards for inclusion of financial education into workforce development with youth and young adults also took effect in WI and nationally through WIOA or the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act."|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0
239|Crop management information for diversified organic vegetable f|Diversified organic vegetable farmers need detailed management information that includes cover crops, reduced tillage techniques, and vegetable crop specifics that contribute to farm profitability. They appreciate research based information and want to hear from their farmer peers working in the field. Farmer-to-farmer information sharing is highly prized in the organic vegetable producer community. Sharing experiences and learning from other practitioners working in the field is an essential component of any education program for this group. This information is taken from the FairShare CSA Coalition Annual Survey (completed by over 50 farms per year), the FairShare Grower Education Committee (6 to 8 farmers tasked with proposing educational programming for their farmer peers), ongoing program evaluation surveys, conversations with farmers, and the Area 18 Situational Analysis.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
240|Increasing Tourism Related Economic Development|The area I serve has a strong and long-standing economic development program led by the Grant County Economic Development Corporation that primarily focuses on the traditional areas of industrial recruitment and business retention. The potential for tourism based economic development is has the potential for significant growth. Tourism studies by the Wisconsin Division of Tourism indicate that total revenues generated from tourism based activities in Grant County is relatively low when compared to other counties in our region. In addition, the lack of a brand hampers our efforts to establish ourselves as a destination for visitors. The surrounding communities of Galena. IL, Dubuque, IA, and Prairie du Chien have strong and effective tourism based business programs. Cooperating with these 'Tier One' communities is an almost completely untapped resource. And our existing chambers have struggled to make consistent progress in tourism development.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
241|Financial Security Programming (2019)|Waushara County is a rural, low-income county in central Wisconsin that is located 80 miles south of Madison, with 24,496 residents. The population is predominantly White and non-Hispanic; the largest minority group is Hispanic, at 6.1% of the population or approximately 1484 people and Black or African Americans at 2.1% of the population or 511 people. 19% of the population is under the age of 18. The Waushara County Average Annual Wage is $31,608 compared to Wisconsin's $46,031. The number of people living in poverty in Waushara County include 32% of single mothers and 16% of children, with 51% of students in the district receiving free or reduced lunch, and 8% of seniors. In the past year 2,112 individuals in 759 households used the Waushara County Commodity Food Pantry on a monthly basis. 66% of them were adults and 34% were children. 2,698 people receive Food Share, with 60% adults and 40% children. Waushara County residents who responded to the 2016 Waushara County Needs Assessment survey, in rating the importance of Family Life Topics, said that Managing Family Income was extremely important and quite important, and was rated second highest in the top ten issues to address through education. In addition, the Vision 2020 workgroup, under the Waushara County Prevention Council, voted that this Extension Faculty chair a dual-county Financial Capability workgroup, Green Lake Waushara Financial Wellness, to increase awareness of Waushara County's economic situation and needs, and provide education to increase financial literacy.|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0
242|Indigenous Curriculum and Methodologies|In October 2018, eXtension Foundation contracted with me and UW-Extension to buy out 85% of my time to serve as Innovation Facilitation Manager through December 31st 2019. This Plan of Work encompasses only the 15% of time that I have dedicated to UW-Extension for the year 2019.Wisconsin is home to eleven Federally Recognized Tribal Nations and one additional Tribe (Brothertown) that is seeking Federal recognition. Some of these Tribes (e.g. Chippewa, Ojibwa, Ho Chunk and Menominee) have always called Wisconsin and the woodlands surrounding the Great Lakes their home. Other Tribes (e.g. Brothertown, Oneida and Stockbridge-Munsee) were forcibly removed from their homelands and relocated to Wisconsin. Regardless of the location of their ancestral homelands and history in Wisconsin, all of the Tribes and/or Bands of American Indians in Wisconsin have different customs, cultural teachings, languages and systems of governance. The eleven Federally Recognized Tribes hold one important policy element in common: They are sovereign nations with full authority to govern themselves. Historical trauma is omnipresent in all of Indian country and this certainly holds true in Wisconsin's Tribal communities and among Tribal members regardless of whether they live on the reservation. Centuries of forced removal, assimilation, systematic cultural and language oppression, termination and boarding school abuses have created, among other things, a lack of trust for educational and other institutions. Extension Educators in this state and others, have long documented a need for continuous relationship building to establish trust-based working relationships. For many years, Tribal leaders, members and affiliated Extension Educators have requested and worked to develop culturally appropriate educational programming that is respectful of Indigenous wisdom and ways of thinking and acting. However, when considering the unique needs, languages and cultural practices of each Band and/or Tribe, culturally appropriate curriculum development needs for a variety of topics is significant. Through brief surveys, one-on-one and small group visits with Tribal leaders, members, Extension Educators and Tribal-serving organizations, a few common culturally appropriate programming needs have emerged: Leadership development, organization development, environmentally-based language restoration, and resources to combat the opioid epidemic. While the topics for these needs vary greatly, the educational response is similar: Utilize cultural teachings to transform and heal. In my literature searches thus far, I have discovered that there are few existing curriculum resources and programs that have been designed utilizing Indigenous methodologies. I believe that if Cooperative Extension (CE) were to be successful in designing culturally appropriate responses, CE would make a significant contribution to the work of Tribal communities nationwide. In turn, Tribal leaders, members and communities have much to teach non-Native communities and scholars. By increasing their understanding of sovereignty, indigenous knowledge and cultural teachings, non-Native communities can improve their ability to learn from, live among, work and partner effectively with Tribal communities.For the 15% of my dedicated UW-Extension time in 2019, I will concentrate on addressing leadership and organizational development needs of Tribal nations; specifically, the Tribal Nations Lead Leadership Development Pilot Program that was co-conceived by Michigan and Wisconsin and that received funding from the North Central Region Community Rural Development Program.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
243|Managing Horticultural Crops and Landscapes with an emphasis on|University of Wisconsin-Extension in Door and Kewaunee Counties have an informal agricultural educator specialization agreement whereby the Door County educator provides programming for crops and soils in both counties, and the Kewaunee Agent covers dairy and livestock. Although neighbors, the agricultural environment in Door and Kewaunee County is quite different. Door County is more than twice the size of Kewaunee County, yet Kewaunee County has 45% more acres of harvested agricultural land (86,505 ac in Door County and 134,654 ac in Kewaunee County; USDA Census of Agriculture 2012). Consequently, in Door County, farmers steward 43% of the county's land, whereas in Kewaunee County, farmers steward 81% of the land (S. Deller, Value and Economic Impact, 2012). The types of crops grown in the two counties also varies. In Kewaunee County, dairy farming is the primary form of agriculture, generating $190 million in milk sales. Door County also has a significant dairy industry ($38.5 million in milk sales) and many farmers grow cash crops, but there is much more diversity in the crops grown. Fruit and berry sales generate $4.4 million towards Door County's economy, compared to the $0.36 million in Kewaunee County. Despite these differences, the similar climatic and geological environment, especially between Kewaunee County and Southern Door County makes many Extension programs and research projects relevant to both counties. In 2016, this agriculture educator conducted a needs assessment survey sent to farmers in Door and Kewaunee County regarding their crop and farm management needs. One hundred fifty six surveys were returned (34% response rate), with exactly 2/3 of the responders from Door County and the remaining 1/3 from Kewaunee County. Overall, the number one issue identified was weed management. Disease and insect management were also in the top ten, making pest management overall a top priority. When the responses were separated based on those who indicated that they grow specialty crops (43 responders of the 156 total (28%) who grow fruit, vegetables, trees, and/or flowers), insect management was the number one issue, disease management was number two, and weed management was number three. Integrated pest management was also a high priority for this sub-group, ranking as the sixth most important need (integrated pest management was the 12th most important need when including all responses). In a targeted survey of 14 cherry growers in Door County, 100% indicated that insect management was their highest concern and disease management was second. Currently there are a number of severe insect pests (e.g. spotted wing drosophila, European chafer, brown marmorated stink bug) that farmers and landowners will need to deal with annually. Farmers and landowners must know what pest(s) they are dealing with, how much damage they can tolerate, and when is the best time to apply treatment measures for effective management. For example, the brown marmorated stink bug was first found in Door County orchards in 2018, so it will be extremely important to continue to monitor where this pest is present. Targeted research trials and scouting reports from Door and Kewaunee Counties, as well as from around the state, can help farmers stay ahead of major issues, and know what steps to take when an issue arises. Door County is also home to the eight largest group of Master Gardener Volunteers based on 2017 memberships. As a partner with UW-Extension, their mission is to make an impact on horticulture in our community through education, community outreach, and stewardship of the environment. The Master Gardener Volunteer's care for an educational garden at the Peninsular Agricultural Research Station that had approximately 8,000 visitors in 2015. They are also involved in many educational projects throughout the entire county and facilitate various educational programs during the winter.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
244|Volunteer Development Priority#1 |"Situation Statement:Adult volunteers are Wisconsin 4-H's most valuable asset in delivering the quality youth-led, adult guided programs to support youth as they acquire essential life skills. Wisconsin 4-H Youth Development has over 10,500 volunteers who are enrolled as UW-Extension 4-H volunteers working with 30,000 youth enrolled in 4-H programs. In 2017, volunteers reported on average they donated over 54 hours per year. Approximately 70% of Wisconsin 4-H volunteers are female and 30% are male. Nationally, women continue to volunteer at a higher rate than men. (Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. Department of Labor.) In Wisconsin 4-H, approximately 97% of the volunteers are white. WI 4-H Youth Development volunteers currently do not reflect the demographics of most counties.In 2018, Polk County had 238 adult volunteers. The demographics of volunteers were 75 male and 160 female with almost all the volunteers being white. Member statics for the same year reflect some more diversity. Of the 667 members, there were 17 Hispanic or Latino; (Up from 7 in 2017), 4 Asians, 3 African Americans, 1 American Indian, 10 youth indicating more than one race, and 23 youth did not self-identify. Volunteers play a critical role in the delivery of quality educational programs. In a survey completed January 2015, 4-H Youth Development staff identified Volunteer Development as an area in need of program support. Additionally, a WI 4-H Youth Development Survey was conducted in February 2014 of over 1500 volunteers. Adult volunteers in 4-H indicated relatively low awareness and understanding of some of the educational principles (Essential Elements and the Experiential Learning Process) that are central to the work of 4-H Youth Development. In the 2014 survey, volunteers expressed an interest in learning through not only face-to-face modalities; but also through online-learning such as webinars and podcasts. The 2017 Strategic Plan released by USDA NIFA and National 4-H Council outlines a 4-H Youth Development Vision for 2025. Nationally the following goal has been established ""Youth are surrounded with competent, prepared staff and volunteers."" This goal includes the following outcomes: ""The 4-H program is supported by a well-trained volunteer force."" ""4-H staff and volunteers engage in meaningful professional development.""In addition, there is a responsibility of volunteers to ensure access, equity and opportunity. The National 4-H Strategic goal states ""All youth engage in program and opportunities."" To that end it has been identified that ""4-H volunteers and staff are skilled, knowledgeable and prepared to work with all members of their community."" Over the past many years Polk County has seen a shift from a primarily rural county to a sub-urban/rural county with urban influences from the major metropolitan Minneapolis/St. Paul area. The rural roots of the county remain a strong foundation for the traditional view of 4-H community clubs. Polk County remains a bedroom community with many parents commuting the 70 plus miles to work in the twin cities area which adds challenges to reaching volunteers and youth for face-to-face trainings and educational opportunities. In 2018, the Polk County 4-H program had a large volunteer base of 238 adults and 667 community club members. The large adult volunteer base enables the program to offer many educational opportunities for youth. Oversight for the program is provided by a large board of directors, comprised of one adult and one youth representative from each of the 22 clubs. This broad representation provides an inclusive perspective, however program management with a board this large can be challenging. The Board serves as a valuable resource to assess the needs of the program and guide program development for the Community Club and Youth Leadership Development; being a continuous needs assessment opportunity. A noted change over the past decade shows that volunteers focus their time on one or two areas in the program due to time constraints and additional demands. Likewise, youth are pulled in many directions with extracurricular activities provided by schools almost every day of the week. Youth also have to focus program participation, enrolling in fewer projects and focusing involvement more narrowly."|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1

246|Improving Socioemotional Health for Youth in Shawano County and|"Mental Health Diseases impact 1 of every 4 people. 1 in every 5 youth will experience a mental health illness. Poor mental health can negatively impact physical health, leading to an increased risk of some health conditions. Stigma is rampant across Northwoods Culture, making the process of seeking health even more difficult than the lack of mental health providers. Compound this with the lack of Mental Health Professionals available to meet our needs: The National Benchmark is 1 provider to 330 people. In Shawano County, we have roughly double that at 1 provider for 650 people (Community Health Rankings.)The suicide rate in Wisconsin is four times the homicide rate. Each year, over 700 Wisconsin residents die by suicide. In addition, approximately 5,500 Wisconsin residents are hospitalized due to intentional, self-inflicted injury. Suicide is the fourth leading cause of years of potential life lost (YPLL) before age 65. Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death for Wisconsinites who are 15-24 (140 deaths) and 25-32 (134 deaths), and 3rd leading cause of death to those 35-44 (143 deaths). This number continues to trend upward for those who fall in the 15-24 year old age range. Depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation are on the rise, and anxiety is high. Students report greater use of screens, less sleep, and poorer self-reported health. Area 8 boasts high rates of excessive drinking (binge or heavy drinking in the past 30 days). Shawano County reports a rate of 24%. The National Benchmark is 13%. In Shawano County, 28% of all vehicle crashes involved alcohol. We have an issue. As one Shawano County Sheriff reflected during the 2019 Departmental Youth Mental Health First Aid Training, ""It sounds like people aren't doing drugs just for fun. This makes me think that folks might be abusing substances as a coping mechanism."" One in five teens and young adults live with a mental health condition - half develop the condition by age 14 and three-quarters by age 24. (National Alliance for Mental Illness.) One in five American children ages three through 17   about 15 million   have a diagnosable mental, emotional or behavioral disorder in any given year. Only 20 percent of these children are ever diagnosed and receive treatment; 80 percent   about 12 million   aren't receiving treatment (TODAY via Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) Health disparities among youth as evident, as were highlighted during Thedacare's Community Health Action Team Process, featuring a plunge into ACES and youth mental health in 2018. During 2018, the CHAT ACES Action team has been diving into data, recognizing that Shawano County is not serving the needs of our youth and families around trauma informed care. The ACEs study found that having adverse childhood experiences was strongly associated with a range of psychological, social and health problems as an adult. Responses to these experiences often manifest in behaviors or conditions that result in involvement with the child welfare and the criminal and juvenile justice system or in difficulties in the education, employment or primary care system.(SAMHSA 2014). Shawano County has a population of workers and residents that have lived through ACES, as well as Native American Tribal members of Menominee, Stockbridge-Munsee, and Ho Chunk, whom have inherited generational trauma. The county is beginning to see that it is necessary to educate workplaces, educational settings, and government systems on the signs and symptoms of ACES, mental health issues, and their connections to child brain development. In addition to serving on the Trauma-Informed Shawano County and ACES Action Teams through Thedacare, I continue to serve as one of two co-organizers of the newly formed Shawano County Alliance for Youth. This coalition brings the community together to empower people through education and resources that support healthy and affordable choices for youth throughout the entire county. Thus far, we have had twelve organizations and 7 school districts represented. There currently is not an AODA Coalition in the area. I continue to address the health needs of young people by serving on the health team that may be formed through the Positive Youth Development and/or Health and Well Being Institutes. I have done state-wide training in Youth Mental Health First Aid, partnering with Jen Park-Mroch, Danette Hoppke, and Tracy Henegar. As individuals and families gain knowledge and skills, and community environments support healthy living, there will be less illness, substance abuse and mental illness. Shawano County and Wisconsin will benefit from these changes through decreased health care costs, increased productivity of our workforce and improved quality of life."|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
247|Research Naturalist Programming at Upham Woods|"Overview of Upham Woods and Current TrajectoryBackground: Upham Woods Outdoor Learning Center is an informal science learning (ISL) center that is a part of the University of Wisconsin System, currently affiliated with UW-Extension (UWEX). Over the last four years, Upham Woods Outdoor Learning Center's increasingly vibrant outdoor classroom and dynamic statewide outreach program have strengthened the quality, diversity, and reach of environmental education in Wisconsin. Fast Facts:  Founded in 1941 318-acre facility Served 11,237 youth and adults in 2018 from 49 Wisconsin counties; served over 500,000 Wisconsinites since 1941 Programming includes:  on-site group visits from schools, 4-H programs, scouts, etc.  outreach learning experiences across the state Current Trajectory Established by Renewed Outreach Efforts and Use of Technology 2014-2018:   Over $1.92 million in cumulative program revenue generated Over $1.01 million investment in capital projects in collaboration with UWEX administration Acquisition of over $1.45 million in extramural support grants for building environmental education capacity and expanding access to programs at Upham Woods as well as to statewide environmental education opportunities, including Digital Observation Technology Skills (DOTS):  Framework developed at Upham Woods and used statewide for integrating modern, mobile technology into outdoor, experiential science educationo 14,591 youth and adults have used DOTS since 2014o Generates hands-on engagement with technology in the context of a classic outdoor learning settingo Digital tool kits are assembled, distributed and supported by Upham Woodso Resulted in 19 peer-reviewed articles authored or co-authored by Upham staff. Upham Woods programming reach has increased 28% in the last 4 years and revenue is up 15% in the same time period. Furthermore, our reach in 2018 was the largest in 32 years and our revenue is the highest in center history.Embracing Technology Rooted in Heritage of Upham WoodsWhen the University of Wisconsin received the donation of land that would become Upham Woods, Wakelin McNeel served as the Center's first superintendent. McNeel was also known as ""Ranger Mac"", a persona he created for a Wisconsin Public Radio show that he hosted. As part of his show, he invited youth and adults from all across Wisconsin to reflect on, observe, engage, and conserve the state's wonderful natural resources. On the program, he often noted that ""If you didn't take a walk yesterday, you missed out on many things that may not come again"" (Matkin-Rawn 2004). Today, we share these same sentiments with our students, encouraging them to observe their surroundings and ask questions that enable them to better understand the world they inhabit. While Ranger Mac worked at Upham Woods in the 1930s and 1940s, many parallels exist between his service to the state and the direction Upham is headed today. Ranger Mac used the technology of the era radio to connect a statewide audience to the environment. By using a resource that was both pervasive and accessible, he drew youth and adults to issues in our natural world and also enabled them to explore Upham Woods. Today, we accomplish these same objectives through the Digital Observation Technology Skills (DOTS) program and web-based resources. Ranger Mac's approach focused on observation and wonder in the outdoors. Today, we use terms such as informal science learning (ISL), inquiry-based instruction, project-based learning and place-based education to describe this same approach. Although there have been many changes in the last 76 years at Upham Woods, it continues to serve a crucial statewide presence in environmental education outreach by leveraging an effective blend of technology and youth development, within a context of vibrant natural resources and scenic beauty.Confidence in this Well-founded ApproachThe National Research Council's research shows that ISL is guided by student inquiry about the natural world, data collection related to their inquiry, and opportunities to present their findings to peers and community members (National Research Council, 2009). Further, the National Research Council states that informal learning environments are, in principle, accessible to all learners, and evidence suggests they have particular potential for supporting learners from non-dominant groups (National Research Council, 2009). In addition to providing experiential learning opportunities grounded in environmental concepts, ISL centers like Upham Woods expand the network of educators and facilitators engaged in environmental education and provide students with ""direct access to compelling phenomena in the natural world"" (National Science Foundation, 2011).While ISL centers, such as camps and nature centers, have historically had programming legacies rooted in the natural sciences, their educational practices can be in tension with the emphasis on the adoption of modern technology that often guides contemporary STEM education (Cuthbertson, Socha, & Potter, 2004). Yet using technology in outdoor education settings holds great promise in deepening scientific connections to local places through data collection. As an example, data collection within a context of location, community, and inquiry provides a place-based approach to education that contributes to active and engaged citizens (Hougham & Kerlin, 2016; Sobel, 2004). In modern science classrooms and careers, most scientific tools are digital. Consequently, adopting digital tools requires ISL centers to strike a careful balance between retaining the connection to place that outdoor, experiential learning promotes and serving youth and educators with modern STEM curricula. Connecting this further, place-based education like that promoted at Upham Woods has been shown to connect learners' STEM engagement to their experiences in informal settings, develop their acute observation skills, and increase their capacity to care about the environment around them (Land & Zimmerman, 2015; Greenwood & Hougham, 2015)."|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

249|Farm Business Managment and Government Policies related to prod|An overview of Rock County Agriculture: As of the 2012 USDA Census of Agriculture Rock County had over 353,700 acres dedicated to crop production with a market value of products sold exceeding $274,420,000 making Agriculture the leading industry in the county. Agriculture production of soybeans ranked highest in the state, corn production ranked 2nd in the state and overall value of agriculture products ranked 14th. Rock County also ranked 1st in pheasant production and 5th in Sheep production1. Having a large urban population as well as a very productive and diverse agriculture sector creates unique programming opportunities for both agriculture production and agriculture literacy. Situation Statement: There are over 1,500 farms in Rock County with a production level ranking 4th in the state for value of crops grown equaling a market value of $165,875,000 according to the 2012 USDA Agriculture Census data1. The large amount of production agriculture coupled with an increase in the cost of agriculture inputs equals a need for educational programs aimed at utilizing inputs for efficient returns in a way that offers long term sustainability. Additionally commodity markets are at a 10 year low and forecasted to remain stagnant to lower. The average market price for corn in 2015 was $3.70/bu. compared with $4.46/bu. In 2014 and $6.89/bu. In 20132. The decreased profit margins for crop producers is creating a need for programing focused on efficient and profitable production practices. This programing will be accomplished in part by utilizing the Rock County Research Farm to conduct relevant field based research trails in collaboration with state specialist and area agriculture producers aimed at increasing the efficiency of agriculture production in Rock County. Additional programing will be conducted aimed at increasing marketing knowledge and economic tools as decision factors in farm management. Initial needs assessments completed by Rock County Farmers indicate the desire for additional programing in the areas of Crop Production and Soil Health further indicating the need for local programing in these areas. Programing in efficient crop production practices as well as soil health and integrated pest management will provide education aimed at successful and sustainable grain enterprises. These programing efforts closely align with the goals of the Agriculture Natural Resources Education (ANRE) Crops Team which is focused on the economic and environmental sustainability of individual cash grain enterprises. Field based research projects in the areas of Corn Production, Soybean Production, Weed and Pest Management, Cover / Companion Crops, as well as Soil Health will be conducted at the Rock County Farm. 1 Data Referenced from 2012 USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service Census of Agriculture County Profile found at www.agcensus.usda.gov2 Data Referenced from USDA Economic Research Service Feed Grains: Yearbook Tables, U.S. Acreage, Production, Yield and Farm Price found at http://ers.usda.gov/data-products/feed-grains-database/feed-grains-yearbook-tables.aspx#26766|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

252|2019 Menominee Family Financial Management|Other Menominee statistics are unsettling, 31.7% of residents live below poverty level (compared to 12.4% for Wisconsin 2010 Census data), highest number of children living in poverty (51% per 2017 County Health Rankings), high unemployment rate (9.9% per 2017 County Health Rankings), highest number of single parent households (61% per 2017 County Rankings data), and 78% of children eligible for free lunch (Applied Population Lab, 2014 County Data). According to the 2014 County Health Rankings, Menominee County has a median household income of $33,925 compared to the state of Wisconsin's median household income of $51,063. The community, however, possesses much strength as well with strong cultural traditions and pride. Many of the current financial issues for Menominee County are present in counties across the state. In a visioning session for the Menominee County/Nation Family Living Educator position in October of 2012, Financial Management was identified as the 4th highest priority program area. Related to financial management, job and school readiness was ranked as the number one priority area and Culture and Values, relationships and respect was 2nd. Fortunately, UW-Extension Family Living Programs are well positioned to assist families in addressing some of these issues through education and coaching efforts. Financial security is the goal for many Americans, including Menominee County residents. Financial security is defined as an individual's or family's ability to meet short-term needs and to prepare for the future. The path to financial security requires accessible and accurate information, as well as financial competency in earning, spending, saving, borrowing, and protecting. The long run objective of financial security begins with establishing financial stability, or the ability to make ends meet. Menominee County/Nation families would benefit from an increased ability to manage cash and credit so they can make ends meet, and also begin to set aside resources for emergencies and to reach future goals. UW-Extension Family Living Programs can offer financial education and information right in the community with no cost and give them resources to move forward from some of the crippling statistics that the Menominee County and Nation face.|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0
253|Nutrition education for racially and ethnically diverse audienc|According to University of Wisconsin-Madison's Applied Population Laboratory, Wisconsin's demographic trends point to an increasingly older population with greater racial and ethnic diversity than in any previous US Census. Most of the aging population is a part of WIsconsin's population of non-Hispanic Whites, which accounts for 83% of the State, with the biggest age group being in the 45-64 age range. The senior population of Wisconsin is 94.5% non-Hispanic White. People of color and people who identify as multiracial have a younger age structure. People who identify as Asian makeup 2% of the population, with young adults aged 15-29 being up the largest proportion of the demographic. The African-American (6%) and American Indian (1%) populations have large groups of 15-19 year olds. The largest age group for people who identified as Hispanic (5.9%) or multiracial (1.9%) are children in the 0 - 4 year age group, with 5 - 9 year olds being the second largest age group.Wisconsin's poverty rate is also expected to increase, with much of the social and economic disparities associated with poverty disproportionately affecting communities of color. The US Census Bureau defines poverty areas as census tracts with at least 20% of its residents at or below the federal poverty line. Research asserts that the well-being of individuals and families living in areas with concentrated poverty, which often have high crime rates, poor schools, and fewer job opportunities, is compromised. Residents living in high poverty areas are often underserved and excluded from mainstream social and economic opportunities and have worse health outcomes. Identifying underserved communities, building relationships with, and increasing access to healthy lifestyle choices at the individual, community, and policy levels provides greater opportunity for communities to engage in activities that promote positive health outcomes. Learning environments that are reflective of learners' culture, including ways of knowing, world views, and learning preferences, are proven to be more effective than those that do not. As a SNAP-ed and EFNEP funded program, FoodWIse is federally mandated to provide nutrition education to individuals with limited resources. The purpose of my position is to assist our colleagues to provide culturally responsive nutrition education. My focus until April 30 will be to review and develop plans for implementing materials that are intended to be used with learners who have identities originating in Southeast Asian, Native American, Black or African American cultures.|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
254|Financial Education Plan of Work 2019|The long run objective of financial security begins with establishing financial stability, or the ability to make ends meet. For many families and individuals, just one shift in the flow of financial resources can be detrimental to financial stability and if persistent, will affect financial security. Access to financial education and information is still limited for many households. As seminars provided by financial services are not affordable for low0 to moderate-income families and individuals. There is a shortage of objective financial education on cash and credit management and risk management. The current need for financial supports in the state evidenced by the 2015 FINRA Financial Capability Survey, which collected data from people in each state to measure financial behaviors, attitudes and knowledge. 53% answered 3 or fewer questions out of 5 on a financial literacy quiz; 47% find it very/somewhat difficult to cover expenses and pay bills; 51% do not have 3-month emergency savings and 28% pay the minimum due on credit cards.Through use of the Financial Security Survey tool with Fond du Lac County Employees and the FDL Co. Wellness Coordinator in 2016, there is a parallel with the 2015 FINRA Financial Capability Survey as the Fond du Lac Wellness Coordinator reported the two highest needs identified were the inability to save for emergencies, as individuals reported the concern of living paycheck to paycheck. Fond du Lac County has a population of 101,968 residents, with the median age of 41 years. Ninety five percent of the county are Caucasian, with 2% Black or African American and almost 2 % Asian with one percent from some other race. Hispanic population is 4.9% of the 101,968 county population. Median household income is $56,376 and from Census, there are 41,029 households with income and benefits in the county. In comparing the median household income and the number of households with income, there are 18,013 households who earn under $ 49,999 - under the median income or 44%. There are 4,114 families with SNAP benefits in the past 12 months- 10% of households. (https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml# )In 2017, United Way Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed (ALICE) survey was released. ALICE provides a framework, language and tools to measure and understand the struggles of the growing households in Fond du Lac County who do not earn enough to afford basic necessities. (https://www.fdlunitedway.org/sites/fdlunitedway.oneeach.org/files/fdl%20snapshot.pdf ) The ALICE report for Fond du Lac County noted based upon 41,938 households, 22% of the households earned more than the Federal Poverty Level, but less than the basic cost of living for Fond du Lac County (the ALICE threshold) Combined, the number of poverty and ALICE households equals the total population struggling to afford basic needs, this number is 33% of the households in Fond du Lac County. Inability to make ends meet financially affects the family beyond the pocketbook as it affects relationships within the family and community due to tough choices are made that affect the family and its members. These choices whether financial or not have long-term consequences for families and communities, which is indicative of future success for all involved.Wisconsin renters currently represent one third of all households in the state. In Fond du Lac County, 28%of occupied housing units are renter occupied. The rental housing market continues to experience strong demand. A record 43.3 million households were renters in 2016, representing a 26.5% increase since 2006 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2017b). Meanwhile, the homeownership rate dropped from 68.8% to 63.4%. As a result of the increased demand for rental housing, the rental vacancy rate in the U.S. declined from 9.8% in the4th quarter of 2006 to 6.9% in the 4th quarter of 2016 (U.S. Census Bureau,2017b). The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the rental cost of a primary residence rose 31.9% over those ten years, which was higher than overall inflation of 19.1% (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2017a).Household income has not kept up with the rising cost of rental housing. From the housing crisis of 2007 to 2015, the median gross rent for a rental home in the U.S. increased by 6%, after adjusting for overall inflation, while the median income for renter households rose by just 1% and median income for all households declined by 4% (U.S. Census Bureau, 2017a).Demand for rental housing will likely continue to rise. Researchers at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard predict additional4.7 million-renter households by 2025 from household growth, even if homeownership rates stabilize (Spader, McCue, & Herbert, 2016). They project far more additional renter households if homeownership continues to decline. Source: Out of Reach 2017, National Low Income Housing Coalition. In Fond du Lac County, 11,613 occupied rental units paying rent were shown to range from less than $500/month to over $3,00 per month with a median rent price falling in at $709 .00 per month (Fact finder Census Gov., 2016). The largest monthly expense families have related to housing costs. Over 33% of FDL renting units have more than 35% of Gross Rent as Percentage of Household Income (GRAPICredit is increasingly important for many areas of life: your ability to get a loan, how much you pay for credit and insurance, securing a job, renting a house or apartment, and preventing identity theft. It is up to individuals to make sure information in their reports is accurate and up-to-date, yet only 1-in-3 Wisconsin adults obtain a copy of their credit report each year - the 6th lowest rate of all states. Many people pay for credit monitoring, which is costly and usually unnecessary.Family financial security programming will help people to improve their financial management capability. This will enhance the financial security which of families in the state, which will benefit communities by boosting economic stability to a foundation for economic growth.|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0

256|Conducting a Needs Assessment|What's Going On Working to complete community needs assessments in both Columbia and Sauk counties, it is emerging that family dynamics within and across generations is a sociocultural hurdle within communities. Raising children, achieving adulthood, maturing successfully, aging with good health and moving through life with competence and confidence are key areas of struggle for most individuals consistently. What was developmentally true or expected of individuals in previous generations is not necessarily developmentally true of generations today. Extension programming will serve to help individuals to bridge this gap by providing educational programming that is timely, accessible, and up to date. Who Cares and Has a Stake The statewide situational statement conducted across the 72 counties in 2018 found 18 points of common challenge in 5 key themes around the state. Within each of these themes a human relationship-based solution has potential. If the interactions or, relationships, between people or groups of people could overcome these challenges then quality of life for all community members could potentially improve. State and local partners have a joint investment in solving these challenges to improve quality of life across Wisconsin for all residents. As a Columbia & Sauk County Extension educator I will participate in and facilitate the building of coalitions locally to problem solve individual and group challenges to human relationships in daily community life. How was this Identified Nationally, the social and cultural issues we face in Wisconsin are evident across our country. The World Health Organization (WHO)'s action plan through 2020 has amongst its four primary goals to, 1) implement strategies for promotion and prevention in mental health, and 2) to strengthen information systems, evidence and research for mental health. As an Extension educator I can support these national goals through outreach with key community partners to advocate for developmental needs of all residents across the human life span, to keep the integration of ACES/ Trauma Informed programming central to the work undertaken, and to help guide the use of resources effectively and efficiently so that the needs are directed at the right issues at the right time.|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0
257|Horticulture for Jail Inmates: Gaining Ground Gardens (2019)|Marathon County has an estimated population of 135,732. The Marathon County Jail was reported to be 70% over capacity with most of those convicted due to drugs or drug related activities. Currently, occupant overage is vetted to other counties, which is an expensive practice. The impact on families of those incarcerated is devastating. Youth are sometimes placed in foster care or shelter homes. The extreme amount of stress associated with this for Marathon County families is immeasurable. Marathon County strives to be the healthiest, safest, and most prosperous county in the State. To this end, collaboration among community leaders, our elected County Board of Supervisors, and Marathon County employees has led to development of a 2018-2022 Strategic Plan, identifying area of focus in the coming years (http://www.co.marathon.wi.us/Portals/0/Departments/CAD/Documents/StrategicPlan_2018-2022.pdf).As a UW-Extension Horticulture Educator, my unique contribution to addressing Marathon County's Strategic Plan, thus far, has been to identify target populations where therapeutic horticulture could improve well-being. After lengthy review of the 2018-2022 plan, there are three populations on which I have been focusing my efforts: 1) jail inmates, 2) county youth, and 3) individuals in addiction recovery or those living with mental illness. For 2019, my plan of work centers mainly upon county jail inmates and community youth, although there is some overlap here with individuals in addiction recovery or those living with mental illness. Based on numerous studies conducted across the globe, it is likely that therapeutic gardens and horticulture programs will positively impact the physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual well-being of individuals in these target populations (American Horticulture Therapy Association, 2018).Upon my hiring, I reached out to stakeholders across Marathon County, and specifically within the City of Wausau where our county jail is located. I provided a series of four public informational sessions to raise awareness of therapeutic horticulture as a viable treatment option for individuals across diverse populations and added two additional programs to more specifically inform Master Gardener Volunteers in Marathon and Portage Counties of our community engagement efforts. Approaches in therapeutic horticulture vary by population and programming provided in 2019 will be research-based. I continue to be told that even if we reach only ONE person through this initiative, we will have made a difference! By not engaging in this situation, UW-Extension will fail to do its part in supporting positive mental and physical health for youth and adults in Marathon County.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
258|Learning Resources Development|"The Positive Youth Development (PYD) Institute has not had a learning resources-related position for approximately 10 years. During that time, there was limited capacity for identifying and developing high-quality learning resources beyond the scholarly work of state and county-based colleagues. It was often challenging for educators to make their work accessible to others for use, much less scale it up for broad awareness and use. Internal and external communication strategies have gone through significant changes with limited staff capacity to maintain or update them.In fact, in an interview with a youth leader from Wisconsin Leadership Council, the young person pointed to two things: a communication gap and an understanding gap in Wisconsin 4-H. While she and her club work closely with the local educator, she suggested there was a disconnect between members and information/opportunities beyond the county boundary. She went on to outline an understanding gap about basic 4-H concepts - ideas such as how to use 4HOnline effectively, what 4-H is about, and how to get involved.2These communication and connection challenges make the Institute less efficient and increases burnout among educators. Colleagues - especially those in the counties - are less able to build on the expertise and experience of others, and everyone must ""reinvent the wheel"" in identifying and/or developing resources to do their jobs effectively. In addition, an influx of new colleagues has taken place in the last year. This group, alongside more experienced colleagues, is in search of accessible lesson plans, teaching tools and curriculum. As expressed many times during the All-Program Conference (APC) in December, 2018, these educators seek consistency of approach, language, and process in many areas. This has been reinforced many times during interviews I've conducted with both new and experienced colleagues as they seek alignment of resources in well-organized digital spaces. That consistency and availability of resources - paper, digital and interactive - supports the flexibility and efficiency they need to implement their local programs with discretion and professionalism. This demand makes many learning resources needs seem urgent.Certainly, some learning resources projects, already in progress, have emerged as straightforward needs with immediate benefits. For example, updates to the 4-H Club Central website was identified as a priority by administration, and work was begun on the project last year. Since this has been a resource gap for several years, the soon-to-be-updated documents and guidance found there will be of immediate value to staff and volunteers alike. Other learning resource needs of similar value and urgency are likely to emerge.However, many other projects needs identified by PYD staff and faculty are urgent, but will take more time to prioritize and develop. Many of the more immediate needs and strategies to focus on are being identified through staff, volunteer and youth interviews. With finite capacity to address all the needs and requests that may arise, efficient, effective, flexible and responsive processes are needed to:1) Identify and vet existing high-quality learning resources that meet the needs of staff, volunteers and youth - many issue discussions during the APC brought this up; this also prevents PYD from wasting resources developing products that already exist.2) Review and prioritize project requests and proposals - allows the Institute to be strategic about where and how staff and financial resources are invested.3) Plan and develop learning resources - minimizes inefficiencies while allowing for creative and thoughtful development within PYD's niche.4) Develop a base of consistent, aligned, easy to access learning resources for staff and volunteers (both youth and adults) to begin to bridge the ""communication and understanding gap"" that has formed in Wisconsin PYD programs.The resources identified and developed through these processes must serve a wide range of audiences, including but not limited to staff, volunteers, youth and others; people in rural and urban settings; people from a variety of affinity groups - racial, ethnic, religious, gender and sexuality, ability, and more; people with varying interests - 4-H (clubs, projects, and more) and community youth development (civic engagement, workforce development, youth-adult partnerships, health, and more); and as described earlier, both new and experienced colleagues. Emily Style wrote that ""no student acquires knowledge in the abstract; learning is always personal. Furthermore, learning never takes place in a vacuum; it is always contextual.""2 In her article, ""Curriculum as Window and Mirror,"" she goes on to describe how children (and all of us) must be able to both see ourselves and our experience mirrored in curriculum and to see through a ""window"" into another experience. In that way, learners' experiences are both validated and expanded upon. Achieving diverse perspectives in learning resources is a crucial element of each of the processes briefly outlined above; learning resources identification and development must support the vision and goals of our Institute, Department and broader institution to break down barriers and make PYD programs - both 4-H and community youth development - welcoming and inclusive of all while addressing specific needs of the audience(s). As a high priority, the processes described above will incorporate structures to help ensure use and development of inclusive learning resources.References:Adams, Holly (2019).

259|Leadership Development in Rural Communities |Rural counties are facing changing demographics that impact local organizations to attract and retain new leaders within their organizations. In early 2018. Juneau County passed a milestone, per the UW Population lab, that over 20% of our population is now over 65 years of age. In doing a profile of our leaders in many of our local organizations, many fit into the new demographic mentioned above. Many local organizations have inquired about succession planning, how do they get new people involve and new ideas/energy, , and how do we develop new leadership for the area to draw from?|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

262| A Common Vision for Oneida County (2019)|The initial evidence for a common vision came in a visioning session and a survey conducted in April 2015. Results were part of this job description. The six priority work areas are:1. Common vision2. Community and Organization Capacity Building and Leadership Development 3. Broadband Development4. Natural Resources and Recreational Trail Development5. Economic Development6. Attract and Retain Young PeopleTo move forward together, residents must share a vision within and among geographic areas of the county, and with like-minded community organizations. I ordered the priorities to reflect the developmental order. A shared vision establishes the context and sets direction for the other identified priorities Shortly after I arrived county supervisors, community organization members, not-for-profit organization leaders, and business people mentioned the lack of a common vision is a fundamental problem in the county. I observed groups had problems making decisions for lack of a common vision. For example, the City of Rhinelander Parks, Buildings and Grounds committee was unable to set priorities when user groups made opposing proposals for development in Pioneer Park.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
263|Dairy and beef animal health, well-being and quality assurance |The demographics of the farmers I program with continues to change. The number of active dairy farms is decreasing, while those remaining are either increasing their herd size or diversifying. Farm stress is elevated in Wisconsin and in Taylor County. Due to the current oversupply of milk, dairy processors have stopped accepting milk from Grade B farms and have discontinued accepting milk from some Grade A farms. Prices paid to farmers for milk, meat, corn and other commodities are flat and below their costs of production. Dairy farmers are either looking to exit or to add other enterprises, including cross- breeding their cattle to beef to capture higher prices for marketing beef feeder calves. Some dairy farms are also considering feeding dairy or dairy- beef cattle for the finished beef market.Consumers increasingly demand assurances that farmers provide good care of animals and the beef or milk provided to them is safe and healthy to consume. The National 2017 Beef Quality Assurance (BQA) Audit of beef processing facilities identified fresh bruises on cattle arriving at facilities. This indicates the need for cattle transportation training and education about cattle handling and welfare. Beginning January 1, 2020 all transporters of cattle arriving at major processing plants must show a certificate of BQA-Transportation training. As of January 1, 2019, Tyson and other processing plants will only purchase cattle from farms that are BQA certified.My Extension experience and professional knowledge as a veterinarian enable me to self-identify my faculty area of focus as dairy and beef animal health, well-being and quality assurance. My programming is aided by my involvement as a state BQA Coordinator, and my involvement with the Extension Dairy and Livestock Teams and the animal well-being workgroup.|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
264|Expanding Capacity for Renewable Energy Infrastructure, Sustain|Organizations and local governments in Ashland County, two tribal nations, and the Chequamegon Bay area have been working steadily over the last five to seven years to increase the number of private homes, businesses, and local governments that get their power from renewable sources. Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels on homes, farms, and infrastructure is the most common form of renewable energy being developed due to the diligent work of a regional nonprofit group called Cheq Bay Renewables. The former Ashland County Extension Community Development Educator also had a lead role in partnering with this group and others including Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, as well as Ashland County administration to meet the region's Energy Independent Community goal of generating 25% of energy locally from renewable source by 2025 (advance regional goals that increase the kilowatts of electricity produced by solar power). (Goals 1 and 2)The region has a 15-year history of developing and implementing a wide variety of initiatives that increase sustainable lifeways such as developing food security with local agriculture, water use practices, waste reuse and reduction, rural transport systems, and other efforts. (Goal 3)Both Ashland and Bayfield counties and the Bad River and Red Cliff tribes have developed natural disaster mitigation plans to reduce or eliminate impacts that occur as a result of natural disasters that may or not be caused by climate change. All planning partners in these four plans have expressed a need for help reaching goals and objectives, as well as help with outreach and information campaigns. Several of the mitigation goals can be accomplished through educational programs through Extension and related partners. For example, there's a goal in the Ashland County Mitigation Plan, recently adopted by the County Board, to conduct outreach about human health impacts caused by increasing temperatures and extreme weather events.

265|Soil Health Nexus|During the past century, the focus on maximizing agricultural production and profitability has centered on technological innovations - improving genetics for disease and insect resistance, herbicide-tolerance, drought and heat tolerance, and higher yields. Traditional yet important agricultural methods, such as building and caring for soil, have gotten less attention. For some farmers, this trend has reduced their long-term sustainability by exacerbating problems such as herbicide resistance, erosion/nutrient runoff, and yield losses from drought and flooding. Soil health improvement can help meet surface and ground water quality goals, reduce soil erosion, and mitigate the impacts of climate change.Recently, farmers, agribusiness, government agencies, and non-profits have begun to recognize the value of soil health and the ecosystem services it can enhance. Implementing a soil health system in the production of food, fiber, and fuel can dramatically impact not only air and water quality, but improve farm economic sustainability and quality of life in rural areas. Investment in research and extension soil health efforts vary widely from state to state, resulting in a wide variation in expertise and support available to farmers and agronomists in the Midwest region. Research has shown that the information agricultural advisors in the public and private sectors are using frequently originates with land-grant universities and extension. With the strong renewed interest in soil health science and practice, it is critical that extension specialists and educators are ready to provide the best science and the best advice for farmers, farm advisors, and the agriculture and food industries.The Soil Health Nexus, an extension-led soil health network, was formed to increasing access to research-based soil health knowledge, extension and resources to extension professionals across the North Central Region, and the audiences they engage. The North Central Region Water Network provides funding support, strategic guidance, communication support, and evaluation support for the Soil Health Nexus, with Rebecca Power, Anne Nardi, and Amber Mase providing primary support.|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
266|Program #2  Market Studies and Local Educational Programs|"SAME AS MAJOR PROGRAM #1Extension education in community business development has a unique position between broader regional economic development and individual business development. It is often focused on a specific community and its trade area. Community business development directly impacts quality-of-life as measured by the availability of services, retail, workspaces, housing, and other commercial activities. Our learners are often interested in downtown revitalization, but are not necessarily limited to a downtown district, or a Main Street program area. One issue facing community business development efforts, especially in rural areas, has been the migration of retail and services to larger commercial centers of the state. In addition, significant changes are occurring in the retail sector that are challenging bricks and mortar stores in favor of online commerce. Even chain affiliated stores, located in malls and shopping centers, are facing challenges today. Many are reducing the size of their store footprints and closing stores in less profitable locations.This provides an opportunity for Extension to help community and business leaders understand the market and develop realistic scenarios for strengthening and expanding local businesses, while maintaining a focus on what's important to community residents. This is especially important in multicultural urban neighborhoods, and small rural communities that are underserved by grocery, pharmacy, medical and other essential services.Program #2-Local Market Studies and Educational ProgramsWork directly with communities and local Extension educators to apply the existing DMA toolbox and new research and resources identified in program #1 to Wisconsin communities:  Prairie du Chien market analysis ($) - completed Brodhead market analysis ($) -underway other communities ($) -expected($) Fee charged for intensive services by UWEXRevisit communities that have recently completed a comprehensive Market Analysis and provide them with assistance in implementing their recommendations:Cross PlainsBellevillePrairie du ChienBrodheadRelaunch a series of topical webinar or teleconference discussions that focus on applying existing tools (like the Downtown Market Analysis toolbox) and new research and resources (developed in Program #1).

267|Trauma Informed Community|"In Winnebago county more than 20% of adults report having had 4 or more traumatic events in their childhood (Wisconsin Child Abuse and Neglect Board). Science has definitively proven that what happens to us in our childhood has lasting impact on our brain development. The science of resilience also provides a great deal of promise as a response to mitigate the negative effects of a childhood shaped by unmitigated toxic stress. Over the course of the last three years, 13 individual agencies and a funder came together with a continuous improvement coach to create a cross-domain toolkit that will education the community in ACEs and provide them with 5 screener tools to increase their awareness of what Trauma-informed could look like. In 2019, after alpha and beta testing we are ready to being the process of rolling this into the community. This work will eventually be carefully scaled to be used by anyone that might be interested. There is a great deal of education that must take place to build will, change perspective and empower community members to create a compassionate community that recognizes that healing can take place in the foundation of compassionate relationships. BACKGROUNDUNDERSTANDING TRAUMA The brain is wired to thrive in the environment that it is constructed. When a brain is wired to adapt and respond to repeated stressors or traumatic experiences, it shapes the way that a person responds and adapts to the world. These behaviors, while critical for survival in highly stressful environments can be maladaptive in every day interactions. When we understand that individuals who have been exposed to trauma and stress are responding in the way that feels safe for them, we are able to take a more compassionate approach to their experiences with us. By recognizing these responses as ones that may be a product of stress we can create healthy, safe, predictable environments that allow for individuals to become empowered. As their self-efficacy increases, their brain begins to form new pathways and adaptive behaviors supporting their growth and healthy choices.Taken from Toolkit IntroductionINTRODUCTION TO TRAUMA-INFORMED CARE When we adopt this way of doing and being, participants and staff feel more empowered and safe. The perception of safety facilitates a higher level of trust, which creates environments that facilitate healing for those affected by trauma and toxic stress. As a universal-precaution, a trauma informed environment supports healthier environments for all. While this toolkit provides you with checklists, evaluation tools, and surveys, we caution you that Trauma-Informed Care (TIC) is not something to be achieved or completed. TIC is the way that we strive to do business. It is the deeply held belief that a compassionate approach is the best practice in our everyday interactions and is a commitment to continuous learning and improvement. TIC requires ongoing critical assessment of policies, staff, training, and hiring policies. While there is no end to TIC there are many opportunities to evaluate and celebrate successes. We recommend that you take the time to weigh each principle and decide how it fits into your organization, and then integrate the framework into your policy and decision-making efforts.WHY THIS MATTERS We know that trauma is pervasive. We cannot tell by just looking at someone if they have a trauma history or if they have or are experiencing toxic stress. Therefore, as a universal precaution, we want to be trauma-informed with all whom we interact so as not to trigger a trauma response. To fulfill the missions of our agencies and strive for the visions of the work we do, it calls upon us to honestly evaluate how existing processes, protocols, interactions, and environments may unintentionally trigger or turn others away from staying engaged with us (or even prevent others from being able to or wanting to engage with us in the first place). And instead, shifting to practices more focused on what works and what helps. Trauma-informed care is doing our work in a way that brought us all to our fields in the first place - to ""do good"". And to ""do good"", we must be willing to creatively, collaboratively, and justly look at how we can challenge the status quo and continually improve to do better."|1|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0

The FEC began as a concept in 1995 with four non-profits co-locating and sharing some services. It expanded to its current form in 1998 when those organizations built a joint building in Grafton and formed the FEC as a separate non-profit to manage the space. The FEC currently houses 10 partner agencies that help build strong families and improve the quality of life throughout Ozaukee County. Several of the partner agencies have requested assistance with team building, staff professional development, and general capacity building. The FEC has also requested board development programming that is open to all 10 partner agencies. The United Way of Northern Ozaukee, which financially supports many of the non-profits housed at the FEC, requested assistance with a facilitated process in 2018. The process is underway and will continue in 2019.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
271|Strengthening Programming to 4-H Clubs in Waushara County|Research shows that high quality programs are more likely to foster positive youth developmental outcomes. High quality programs are characterized by 4 key elements, 1.safe, inclusive, and welcoming environment; 2. supportive and caring adults; 3. content that simultaneously challenges and sparks passion and interest; 4. high levels of youth voice in program decision making. Together, these elements promote youth engagement, and in turn the developmental and practical skills for youth to succeed. Programs that focus on maximizing each of the high quality elements are more likely to be engaging for participants.These key elements are especially important for 4-H and extension based programs because each element is within the control of program educators and participants. The elements can change and improve over time. By monitoring and evaluating each of the key elements, program leaders can adapt and improve the program to maximize positive youth development outcomes for all participants.Research with 4-H members nationally has shown that programs that implement these elements contribute to positive developmental outcomes including: 1. academic motivation and success; 2. social competence; 3. personal standards; 4. contributions to others,; 5. connections to others; and 6. personal responsibility. In turn, these developmental outcomes in the longer term contribute to increased academic and vocational success, civic engagement, economic stability and overall well-being.In Waushara County, there are (14) community clubs and (286) 4-H youth members in 2019, compared with (285) members in 2018. While the number of 4-H members and leaders has remained constant from 2018 to 2019, participation and engagement in trainings, meetings, activities, programming and workshops has increased.|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1
272|Volunteer Development (2019) and High Quality Youth Programs (2|"VOLUNTEER DEVELOPMENTAdult volunteers are Wisconsin 4-H's most valuable asset in delivering the quality youth-led, adult guided programs to support youth as they acquire essential life skills. Wisconsin 4-H Youth Development has over 9,650 volunteers who are enrolled as UW-Extension 4-H volunteers working with 30,000 youth enrolled in 4-H programs. In 2018, volunteers reported on average they donated over 58 hours per year. Approximately 72% of Wisconsin 4-H volunteers are female and 28% are male. Nationally, women continue to volunteer at a higher rate than men. (Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. Department of Labor.) In Wisconsin 4-H, approximately 97% of the volunteers are white. WI 4-H Youth Development volunteers currently do not reflect the demographics of most counties.In 2018, Green County had 204 adult volunteers. The demographics of volunteers were 67% female and 33% male with approximately 2% of the volunteers being white. Green County demographics indicates there is a potential audience of volunteers who reflect a Hispanic ethnic group who are currently not volunteering in 4-H Youth Development.Volunteers play a critical role in the delivery of quality educational programs. In a survey completed January 2015, 4-H Youth Development staff identified Volunteer Development as an area in need of program support. Additionally, a WI 4-H Youth Development Survey was conducted in February 2014 of over 1500 volunteers. Adult volunteers in 4-H indicated relatively low awareness and understanding of some of the educational principles (Essential Elements and the Experiential Learning Process) that are central to the work of 4-H Youth Development. In the 2014 survey, volunteers expressed an interest in learning through not only face-to-face modalities; but also through online-learning such as webinars and podcasts. The 2017 Strategic Plan released by USDA NIFA and National 4-H Council outlines a 4-H Youth Development Vision for 2025. Nationally the following goal has been established ""Youth are surrounded with competent, prepared staff and volunteers."" This goal includes the following outcomes: ""The 4-H program is supported by a well-trained volunteer force."" ""4-H staff and volunteers engage in meaningful professional development.""In addition, there is a responsibility of volunteers to ensure access, equity and opportunity. The National 4-H Strategic goal states ""All youth engage in program and opportunities."" To that end it has been identified that ""4-H volunteers and staff are skilled, knowledgeable and prepared to work with all members of their community.""HIGH QUALITY YOUTH PROGRAMSResearch shows that high quality programs are more likely to foster positive youth developmental outcomes. High quality programs are characterized by 4 key elements: (1) safe, inclusive, and welcoming environment, (2) supportive and caring adults, (3) content that simultaneously challenges and sparks passion and interest, and (4) high levels of youth voice in program decision making. Together, these elements promote youth engagement, and in turn, the developmental and practical skills for youth to succeed. Regardless of the type of program (in-school, after-school, on-going, or sporadic), programs that focus on maximizing each of the high quality elements are more likely to be engaging for participants. These key elements are especially important for 4-H and Extension-based Positive Youth Development programs because each element is within the control of program educators and participants. The elements can change and improve over time. By monitoring and evaluating each of the key elements, program leaders can adapt and improve the program to maximize positive youth development outcomes for all participants. Research with 4-H members nationally has shown that programs that implement these elements contribute to positive developmental outcomes including: 1) academic motivation and success, 2) social competence, 3) personal standards, 4) contributions to others, 5) connections to others, and 6) personal responsibility. In turn, these developmental outcomes in the longer term contribute to increased academic and vocational success, civic engagement, economic stability, and overall wellbeing.https://health.oregonstate.edu/sites/health.oregonstate.edu/files/thriving-model/pdf/2018-thriving-model-summary-booklet.pdf"|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1
273|Addressing Labor Force Quantity and Quality in Wisconsin|The Center for Community and Economic Development was designated as a U.S. Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration University Center (UC) in 2016. In 2019, I will continue pursuing the work plan that we submitted as part of this designation. As part of this work plan, I will continue to address labor force availability in Wisconsin as an issue of both the quantity and quality of workers. Since I submitted my plan of work in 2018, very little has changed in terms of labor force challenges and businesses, economic development professionals and elected officials continue their desire to understand regional labor force conditions and develop strategies to find a sufficient supply of employees. Again, the importance of this issue is not surprising due to structural trends, such as slow population growth and an aging population, that have been documented by UW-Madison's Applied Population Laboratory, the Center for Community and Economic Development, and the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics. Similar conditions also have been noted by the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development. We can continue to address this issue using our research capacity and educational programs.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
274|Improving Health in Lincoln County|"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not just the absence of sickness or frailty. A variety of factors influence a person's state of health including biological, socioeconomic, psychosocial, behavioral, or social. Health equity is achieved when all people have ""the opportunity to 'attain their full health potential' and no one is 'disadvantaged from achieving this potential because of their social position or socially determined circumstance'."" Family life and social support in Lincoln County has shown health disparities among youth as evident during our recent Community Health Improvement Planning process. According to the Wisconsin Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention Board, from 2011 - 2015, Lincoln County was the second highest in the state in prevalence of residents reporting 4 or more ACEs, also known as childhood trauma. The ACEs study found that having adverse childhood experiences was strongly associated with a range of psychological, social and health problems as as adult. Responses to these experiences often manifest in behaviors or conditions that result in involvement with the child welfare and the criminal and juvenile justice system or in difficulties in the education, employment or primary care system.(SAMHSA 2014). As a member of the Live Well Lincoln (formerly Healthy People Lincoln County) partnership committee, I have assisted the Health Department in the development and implementation of Community Health Improvement Process (CHIP) for 2012-17 CHIP and continuing to do so for the current 2018-2023 CHIP. The current plan details goals, objectives and strategies to address the health priorities identified through the assessment process completed in 2017. The priorities identified include Mental Health and Substance Abuse, Nutrition and Healthy Foods, and Oral (Dental) Health. In addition, to the partnership committee guiding the overall plan, each priority area is being worked on by a community coalition - Healthy Minds for Lincoln County, Nutrition Coalition and Healthy Smiles Coalition. Social determinants and health equity are additional overarching target priorities the each coalition and the partnership committee are addressing. In developing their action plan, each coalition utilized the socio-ecological model which provides a framework to think about the complexity of influences on health. At the individual level, age, income, race/ethnicity and the presence of a disability can influence an individual's health. Interpersonal factors include peer and family influences. At the environmental levels (organizational and community), schools, workplaces, recreational facilities, access to resources, and healthcare institutions influence the health choices people make. The social-ecological model can be used to develop, implement and evaluate comprehensive interventions at multiple levels. Efforts to improve health are more likely to be successful when using a coordinated, system-wide approach (U.S. Dept. Agriculture, 2010). (More information about the Live Well Lincoln (CHIP) can be found at http://lincolncountyhealthdepartment.com/healthy-people-lincoln-county-hplc-2/ .)In addition to serving on the Live Well Lincoln partnership committee, I continue to serve as one of two co-organizers of the newly formed Healthy Minds for Lincoln County Coalition. The Healthy Minds for Lincoln County coalition brings the community together to empower people through education and resources to support healthy choices regarding substances and social and emotional well-being. The Lincoln County Drug Free Coalition (I was one of the original organizers of this coalition in 2003 and have served as chair since 2012) and Lincoln County Mental Health Coalition (original member of this coalition) made the decision in early 2018 to combine into this newly merged Healthy Minds for Lincoln County coalition which they officially did on July 12, 2018. Mental Health and Substance Use are related issues and many individuals wish to work on both so forming a new merged group was deemed to be an effective way to proceed. Currently, eighteen agencies and organizations are members of the Healthy Minds for Lincoln County coalition. With the change in my role on September 1, 2018 from the 4-H Youth Development Educator to the Positive Youth Development and Health and Well Being Educator, I continue to address the health needs of young people and am expanding efforts to address the health needs of residents across the age spectrum. This expanded programming includes oversight for the existing Strong Bodies program that reaches 150 individuals in Merrill and Tomahawk, partnering with Pine River School for Young Learners on social emotional well-being programming, offering the Taking Care of You - stress reduction program; and joining the Live Well Lincoln Nutrition Coalition, Lincoln County Parent Support Network, Lincoln County Youth Justice Collaborative and a new Aging Coalition being formed by the Aging Disability Resource Center. Beyond Lincoln County, I serve as a Board member for the Northwoods Coalition (https://northwoodscoalition.org/ ), serve as a member of the UW-Extension Opioid Task Force (https://blogs.extension.wisc.edu/opioids/ ), and will consider serving on health teams that may be formed through the Positive Youth Development and/or Health and Well Being Institutes. As individuals and families gain knowledge and skills, and community environments support healthy living, there will be less illness, obesity, chronic disease, substance abuse and mental illness. Lincoln County and Wisconsin will benefit from these changes through decreased health care costs, increased productivity of our workforce and improved quality of life for all Wisconsin residents including Lincoln County."|0|0|1|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0
275|Lake Superior NERR Education Program|In order for citizens to develop a deeper sense of place and participate in informed coastal stewardship and landscape protection, they require access to information about emerging issues in the Lake Superior watershed and the St. Louis River Estuary. In response, content related to climate impacts such as flooding, increased temperature and turbidity, and harmful algae blooms as well climate remediation and mitigation strategies should be incorporated into Estuarium exhibits, public programs and NOAA's Teachers on the Estuary/K-12 Estuary Education programs. In accordance with the Great Lakes Marine Debris Action Plan, conservation action education programming can support both marine debris prevention and removal in the St. Louis River estuary and Lake Superior. The Reserve education program provides support for partner efforts in elevating traditional ecological knowledge and biocultural wellbeing as important means of understanding, connecting to and restoring the landscape of the St. Louis River.|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
276|Addressing Family Financial Capability in Iowa County|Iowa County is located in southwest Wisconsin, just west of Madison and Dane County. According to data from the American Community Survey (http://factfinder2.census.gov), the population estimate in 2017 was 23,715 in 9,500 households. About 7,000 residents live in our two cities of Dodgeville and Mineral Point and the balance live in our several small villages and in the rural areas. Just over 60% of our households are made up of married couples, 1/3 of our households have children, and 25% of our households are adults living alone. The racial and ethnic makeup of Iowa County has changed slightly over the decades. The 2017 population estimate is 96% White, 0.7% Black or African American, 0.7% Asian, and 1.1% Two or More Races. The ethnicity in Iowa County is 1.8% Hispanic or Latino which is a 459% increase from 2000. In numbers, the Iowa County Hispanic or Latino population increased from 75 in 2000 to a 2017 estimate of 344. Similar to Wisconsin data, 94% of Iowa County residents over age 25 have graduated from high school and 25% have a bachelor's degree or higher. The Iowa County mean household income was $77,000 compared to the Wisconsin mean household income of $74,000. Our primary employment was related to education/health care/social assistance (21%), retail trade, specifically Lands' End (19%), and manufacturing (13%). Although we appear to be a very rural county, only 7% of our employment is related to agriculture. Our per capita income has increase almost 15% since 2010 while the state per capita income increased 11% in that same time period. Eighty percent (80%) of Iowa County parents with children under age six were in the workforce compared to 74% of Wisconsin parents with children the same ages. The unemployment rate in Iowa County peaked in 2010 at 11% and in October 2018 it was 2.1%. Wisconsin's unemployment rate is currently 3.2%. According to the 2016 Point-in-Time Data from the United Way ALICE Report for Wisconsin (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed), 10% of Iowa County households are living in poverty and 24% of our households are considered ALICE. Both of these percentages are slightly below the state data. Our senior citizen poverty rate is 10% with another 32% of senior households considered ALICE (https://unitedwaywi.site-ym.com/page/2018ALICEbyCounty ). Homeowners make up 76% of the households in Iowa County with 24% of the households being rentals. Of the Iowa County and Wisconsin homeowners with a mortgage, 23% are spending more than 1/3 of their monthly income on housing and related homeowner costs. Thirty-five percent (35%) of Iowa County renters are spending more than 1/3 of their income for housing. In January 2019, the Community Development & Human Development Extension Educators in Iowa County developed a financial education survey with the cooperation of a partner agency from Dodgeville. Although the survey is still open, we have collected 88 responses and learned that: 47% of respondents don't always feel they have control over their day-to-day or month-to-month finances56% don't know if they would have a cushion for on unexpected expense or emergency42% don't feel they have the flexibility to have money for occasional extra spending60% are not sure they would be able to meet a financial goalMore than half of respondents would like to learn more about managing their money, saving their money, investing their money, and protecting their money. About one-third of respondents want to know more about making money and accessing retirement accounts with minimal tax consequences. 60% of respondents selected 3 or more of the 8 topics to learn about80% of respondents are interested in attending in-person classes on these topicsThe data indicates that Iowa County families have financial resources but many of them are also facing challenges. They are also eager to learn. My primary work in Iowa County for 2019-2020 will focus on responding to those interests and needs related to financial well-being with education and partnerships that intended to enhance the ability of individuals and families to manage their resources and support their families.|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0
277|Parent and Relationships Education Plan of Work 2019|Research is clear that strong family and other interpersonal relationships significantly contribute to the health and well-being of individuals across the lifespan. Family strengthening programs and policies help build strong relationships within supportive communities, improving outcomes for children, families and society. Families perform a variety of key functions that contribute to both the mental and physical health of individuals as well as the public health and functioning of society. Throughout all developmental stages strong healthy relationships help families effectively and efficiently raise healthy children, care for vulnerable members and sustain productive workers and contributing community members. Research shows that when families build strong relationships within supportive communities many sources of stress are reduced and outcomes for children, families and society improve. Children thrive in school and life. Parents and caregivers are better prepared to provide sensitive and responsible care: The negative effects of incarceration, conflict, and other family stressors decrease. Lifelong mental, physical and emotional health is promoted. (2018 Human Development and Family Relationships State Team Plan of Work). Sometimes families need extra help in creating healthy relationships and experiences for their children which Extension addresses through education and community collaborative work designed to build family strengths. Fond du Lac County has a population of 101,968 residents, with the median age of 41 years. Ninety five percent of the county are Caucasian, with 2% Black or African American and almost 2 % Asian with one percent from some other race. Hispanic population is 4.9% of the 101,968 county population. Median household income is $56,376 and from Census, there are 41,029 households with income and benefits in the county. In comparing the median household income and the number of households with income, there are 18,013 households who earn under $ 49,999 - under the median income or 44%. There are 4,114 families with SNAP benefits in the past 12 months- 10% of households. (https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml# )In 2017, United Way Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed (ALICE) survey was released. ALICE provides a framework, language and tools to measure and understand the struggles of the growing households in Fond du Lac County who do not earn enough to afford basic necessities. (https://www.fdlunitedway.org/sites/fdlunitedway.oneeach.org/files/fdl%20snapshot.pdf ) The ALICE report for Fond du Lac County noted based upon 41,938 households, 22% of the households earned more than the Federal Poverty Level, but less than the basic cost of living for Fond du Lac County (the ALICE threshold) Combined, the number of poverty and ALICE households equals the total population struggling to afford basic needs, this number is 33% of the households in Fond du Lac County. Inability to make ends meet financially affects the family beyond the pocketbook as it affects relationships within the family and community due to tough choices are made that affect the family and its members. These choices whether financial or not have long-term consequences for families and communities, which is indicative of future success for all involved. Fond du Lac County families are integral to the county's population and looking at the youngest county members, there are 5,695 children less than five years of age. (https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml# ) Consistent, nurturing relationships are of vital importance to healthy development of children in Fond du Lac County. Strong supports are needed throughout the family lifecycle especially when there are outside forces which affect the family- opioid addiction, mental health challenges, foster parenting and incarceration are present in Fond du Lac County and the families who live here. Supporting families through outside challenges requires collaborative community supports to build resiliency and strength in families as they address challenges and strive to support a healthy relationship for their family and its members. Additionally, when a family goes through divorce, separation, and foster care placement it can be difficult to adjust to the changes. Education and resources offer strategies to educate parents and children about the impact of the family transition and adjustment to their new life as co-parents. Further, co-parenting education and resources are needed by families that have children, yet were not married to one another and foster care parents co-parenting with biological parents need assistance co-parenting as well. More than 14,000 Wisconsin children experience their parents' divorce each year; this number does not include children of unmarried parents who separate, or those who never lived together. Exposure to conflict is the single biggest factor affecting children as they transition from one household to two. In 2018, Fond du Lac County had 566 Marriages, 314 Divorces, 182 Divorces w/minor Children (57.96%) and 102 Paternity cases. This statistic for the county has been consistent for the past 3 years. On average, 300+ individuals attend the Co-Parenting and Paternity Co-Parenting classes held in Fond du Lac County annually.|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0
278|Positive Youth Development; Wisconsin 4-H |Situation Statement: Youth leadership requires development programs and tools to educate young people to reach their full potential and be successful. Wisconsin 4-H offers programs to aid in this process. In order for this process to be successful, adult volunteers and community members need to work together to sustain these programs in order to help youth grow and learn. Adult volunteers lead trainingsessions, programs, project activities, and leadership events to support 4-Hyouth in the Pepin County Community. Not only do the 4-H Adult leaders play apart in the success of our youth, but the community plays a vital role.Connecting the dots from the community to our 4-H youth is an important rolefor Wisconsin 4-H to play. To create the strongest youth/adult partnership for our program, it is important that adults are provided with the knowledge, training, and skills to help youth be as successful as possible. In order to meet with goal, communication and collaboration are vital in this process. Maintaining and creating community partnerships which will strengthen and grow the program are necessary in Barron county. Finding the best ways to communicate with leaders and community partners is also imperative to the success in youth programming.|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1
279|FOSTERING WELLNESS THROUGH PROGRAMMING AND LEADERSHIP DEVELOPME|"National: Improving health outcomes has been at the forefront of National, State and County awareness for many years. Extension specifically has seen the value in supporting programs to address the wide array of health indicators. The National Cooperative Extension system realized the need to intentionally address this emerging field of health in 2010 and subsequently created the National Framework for Health and Wellness in 2014. Wisconsin: UW Extension updated their strategic priorities in 2017. UW-Extension's mission is ""Through UW-Extension, people of Wisconsin and beyond can access university resources and engage in learning, wherever they live and work"". And one way UW Extension has planned to fulfill its mission is by ""Addressing the changing needs of the state and society by conducting, applying, and conveying relevant university research."" UW-Extension has had health related goals and plans prior to in 2015. The anticipated public value of doing this work can be found in the 2018 Healthy Living Team Plan of Work. https://blogs.ces.uwex.edu/flpteams/healthylivingteam/ UW-Extension has a unique role in responding to the above needs at the community and state level. We are positioned in countries with direct links to community partners, stakeholders and residents. We have links to University data and research. UW-Extension can better develop and support community-academic research partnerships, translate health interventions for dissemination for community leaders, and directly teach and create policy to better impact community health. UW-Extension's statewide current plans of work include: Food & Culture WorkGroup Plan of Work: ""A healthy population is critical to a prosperous and productive Wisconsin. Based on information from County Health Rankings, Community Health Improvement Process (CHIP) & Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) data, as well as State Surveillance data, we find a high prevalence of overweight or obesity children and adults, poor dietary patterns, continuing food insecurity, and the prevalence of food assistance programs and use of food pantries. According to findings from the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW), the state's obesity rate is 4.5 percent higher than the national average obesity rate of 34.9 percent. Obesity rates are higher in persons who are older, poor, less educated, minorities, or those who live in a community with high economic hardship. Additionally, more than 1 in 9 Wisconsin households are food insecure, meaning they lack access to sufficient foods to support a healthy and active life. A 2014 Feeding America Hunger Study found that nearly 2 in 3 low-income Wisconsin households plan for a charitable food assistance as a part of their monthly household budget. Food insecurity has negative impacts on health, including nutrient deficiencies, low birth weight and premature birth, and chronic stress."" Active Communities Plan of Work: ""Physical Activity has been shown to reduce the risk for chronic health conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and certain types of cancer. In addition, physical activity helps with weight management, improving mental health, and strengthens muscles and bones. Physical inactivity has also been associated with increasing the risk for chronic disease. According to County Health Rankings, 83% of Wisconsinites report having access to physical activity, with reporting of the lowest access to exercise opportunities at 7% and the highest at 99%. In addition, 21% of Wisconsin residents report that they get no leisure time physical activity (4). The Active Communities team strives to increase physical activity opportunities for all members of the community using Active School and Active Communities Strategies, StrongWomen and other evidence-based programs. By using evidence-based programs to increase physical activity in schools and communities, and by increasing access to physical activity opportunities, individuals will have the knowledge and ability to be more physically active to improve their health. Efforts of the Active Communities team will enhance and improve physical activity levels across the state and thus, improve the health and overall quality of life of Wisconsin residents."" Health Equity Plan of Work: ""Leading public health practitioners and researchers agree that to improve health, we must advance health equity. Health equity occurs when all people have the opportunity to achieve their full potential for health and well-being (CSDH, 2008). Health inequities are differences in population health status and health outcomes that are systemic, unjust, and actionable, they are not random or caused by individuals who become ill (Whitehead, 1992). Internationally, health inequities prevent many countries from reaching optimal population health outcomes (Marmot et al., 2008). Inequities not only impact individuals directly but also impact the communities where those individuals live. All parts of communities' experience ripple effects from infectious diseases, consequences of alcohol and drug misuse and abuse, and the occurrence of violence and crime that tend to increase as inequities increase (Woodward & Kawachi, 2000). Moreover, health inequities are incredibly costly. Between 2003 and 2006, the combined costs of health inequities and premature death in the U.S. was estimated at $1.24 trillion (LaVeist, Gaskin, & Richard, 2009)."" The state of Wisconsin continues to address health via many different venues and departments. The Department of Health and Human Services most recent WI Health Improvement Plan includes health improvement needs in the areas of nutrition/physical activity and alcohol/drugs/tobacco use. Rock County: As the years have gone by, I continue to keep current with local data, population trends, and emerging issues. Rock County is unique in its population, demographics, and distribution of resources. Rock County's current population is 162,309 and continues to rank among Wisconsin's most populous counties. Demographically, Rock County is 91% White, 9% Latinx, and 5% African American. Rock County is a combination of urban and rural. It also has pocket areas of high poverty and low socioeconomic status. As the population is trending upward, so are the number of families living in poverty and experiencing health disparities, specifically in African American and Latinx communities. There are many needs in Rock County. Data that Rock County is in very poor health compared to the state and national averages cannot be ignored. Poverty and health have risen to the top of the needs in our community since I started in 2005.2005: I began this job, the needs assessment that I completed indicated that health and wellness were the top priority. 2007 & 2010: Rock County UW-Extension's comprehensive community needs assessment was completed in 2007 and 2010 and each year the office takes time to look at updated community data and emerging issues. Both of the needs assessments' data indicated that health was the number three priority behind poverty and economic development 2012: Community Action and United Way of Rock County determined health was in the top 3 issues facing Rock County. 2014: Comprehensive Needs Assessment by Rock County and community partners indicated many areas of health were not being addressed in the county. 2016: In 2016 Community Action of Rock County did a comprehensive needs assessment and the top seven poverty trends and problems were indicated as: population/racial disparity, employment, poverty, housing, health, education and transportation2018: Recently our new Area Director lead a team through another needs assessment and the top three themes that came out of it were: Health/Wellbeing, Poverty (employment, housing, underserved audiences and community/organizational development. The County Health Rankings suggest that in 2018 Rock County was ranked 69 out of 72 counties for Quality of Life and 66 out of 72 counties for Poor Health Behaviors (i.e., unhealthy weight, physical activity, nutrition/food environment index, smoking, excessive alcohol drinking, sexually transmitted infections). Rock County falls in the highest category of overdose deaths, hospitalizations and emergency room visits linked to opioids and heroin according to the Wisconsin's department of human services. underlying many of these health outcomes are: poverty & Asset-Limited-Income-Constrained-Employed (ALICE), health disparities, and adverse childhood experiences (ACES). Poverty/ALICE: The overall poverty rate in Rock County is 14.7% with 20% of children living in poverty. Traditional measures of poverty do not capture the amount of people who are struggling with limited opportunities to thrive. The ALICE metric is a way to look at the true number of families struggling to make ends meet. Disparities: Rock County has significant health disparities outcomes. Specifically racial and ethnic health disparities exists with increased teen pregnancy, infant mortality, sexually transmitted infections, and chronic conditions.ACES: Rock County has the highest percent of high-risk people who admitted to four or more ACE indicators. One in four adults in Rock County have high ACE By choosing to work in the area of health, racial/ethnic/poverty Equity and leadership, does NOT mean that the other areas of family living are not being addressed in Rock County.I have done programming in parenting, childcare education, financial literacy, food safety. Most of this programming was direct educational efforts. When I choose to go part-time while expanding my family, I had a backfill specifically working on the above programs. The backfill made little headway and had low participation in these programmatic efforts. Consistent data show that the primary reason for poor health is unhealthy individual behaviors, which is a product of unhealthy systems, policies, and environments. Research also indicates that improving the health of individuals and populations can:Strengthen families and communities by lowering stress, improving health outcomes, improving social support, improving quality of childcare setting and improving family relationships. Improve family financial security and save communities money With an intentional decreased appointment of 60-80% from 2010-2015, it was essential that I committed to ONE broad program area for success. I took on the role of interim WNEP Coordinator in 2012-2013, Co-Department Head in 2014, Faculty Senate in 2016. I also took on statewide leadership roles of Wisconsin StrongWomen Ambassador in 2007 and Emotional Intelligence Training Team in 2013. I returned to a full time appointment in 2015. My programming efforts are inline with UW- Extension's past, current and future vision.Ultimately, I framed my programming objectives, efforts, and evaluation with the following structure. FOSTERING WELLNESS and LEADERSHIP in ROCK COUNTY and WI by:Coalition Building and Collective Impact through Education, Partnerships, Systems, Environments and Policy ChangesCreating and Strengthening LeadersReaching Underrepresented Audiencesscores which lead to significant negative health outcomes. (ie obesity, addiction) Relating to poor health, here is some more specific Rock County data It is also important to note that that 25% of healthcare costs incurred by working adults are due to modifiable risk factors such as poor diet and inactivity. Wisconsin's annual obesity-related medical costs were estimated at $1.5 billion, of which almost $626 million were Medicaid and Medicare expenditures. In 2005, there was little strategic effort being done to address the issue of health in our county and broader in the Department of Family Development within UW-Extension. With the support from my department, my mentors, and administration, I pursed to fill the health need in Rock County with my work. Our local needs assessment also showed a huge disparity in organizations and individuals working in the area of public health to address these concerns at the local level. I carefully analyzed health data, economic development data, school data, and population trends of Rock County and further broke down that information specific to our rural and urban pockets of the county. After taking in all known data sources and the completion of the UW-Extension and Rock County Health Needs Assessment, I determined that my primary focus could be described as fostering wellness and leadership in Rock County. I created a logic model to guide my programming efforts. These efforts would not only reach Rock County and WI Residents but also positively impact the systems, environments and policies that improve health. By choosing to work in the area of health, racial/ethnic/poverty Equity and leadership, does NOT mean that the other areas of family living are not being addressed in Rock County.I have done programming in parenting, childcare education, financial literacy, food safety. Most of this programming was direct educational efforts. When I choose to go part-time while expanding my family, I had a backfill specifically working on the above programs.

282|(2019) Opioid Capacity Building for UWEX staff|The misuse of and addiction to opioids is a serious national health crisis that has grown to epidemic status. In 2016, the national rate of opioid related deaths was 13.3 deaths per 100,000. The rate of drug overdose deaths has steadily increased in the last decade. In 2016, national rate of drug overdose deaths was more than three times the rate in 1999.In Wisconsin, the drug overdose death rate is higher than the national average. Wisconsin has a rate of 15.8 deaths per 100,000 or (865 people). This statistic refers to only opioid related deaths. Countless more Wisconsin residents are affected by opioid addiction from those who are currently addicted, to children in foster and kinship care due to neglect and/or abuse associated with their parents' drug addiction. The fallout from addiction includes eviction, homelessness, criminal history, unemployment, adverse childhood experiences (ACES), among many others. These rates are expected to soar with the rise in opioid use.|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0
283|Family Economic Security and Financial Literacy (2019)|Families in Wisconsin struggle to make end meets, with 17% of our children living in poverty and 31% of these children live in single parent households. There are 286,829 families with 405,611 young children. In Wisconsin, 43% (172,526) of young children live in low-income families. (National: 45%) We know that families perform a variety of key functions that contribute to both the mental and physical health of individuals as well as the public health and functioning of society. Throughout all developmental stages, from the prenatal period to the last years of life, strong healthy relationships help families effectively and efficiently raise healthy children, care for vulnerable members, and sustain productive workers and contributing community members. Despite recent reports of overall improvement in employment and gains in median incomes, the economic recovery in Wisconsin has been uneven. Many families continue to face challenges from low wages, depleted savings, and the increasing cost of basic household goods. The total number of Wisconsin households that cannot afford basic needs increased 5 percent between 2010 and 2016. The 2016 ALICE report noted 24% of Wood County residents qualified as Asset Limited Income Constrained and Employed. This is consistent with the UWSWAC Financial Stability survey results from Fall of 2017 that noted 69% of participants reported never having been taught how to manage their money and 49% in the Fall of 2018 reported not having an emergency savings. Financial security is the goal for many Americans. Financial security is defined as an individual's or family's ability to meet short-term needs and to prepare for the future. The path to financial security requires accessible and accurate information, as well as financial competency in setting goals, earning, spending, saving, borrowing, and protecting. But it is not enough to just provide learners access to these concepts. The Wood County Family Living Educator, promotes financial capability more broadly, which includes how learners apply what knowledge they have combined with access to community partners and services, prior experiences, attitudes and behaviors.Work will focus on helping families build their financial literacy capacity by: Providing tools to increase their knowledge of financial concepts and strategies of budgeting, creating a spending plan and maintaining good credit. Providing financial capability programs to address increasing or rebuilding credit worthiness and individual financial capacity.[1] http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/sites/default/...[2] http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/sites/default/...[3] http://www.nccp.org/profiles/WI_profile_8.html|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0

I am a leader and key connector, both in providing direct financial education and organizing local partnerships. In the 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment, residents identified the top 3 social issues as: Housing, Household Financial Stability, and Jobs & Economy. Richland County has many young families and is close to the state average when it comes to percentage of children under 5 and children under 18. In Richland County, 19.5% of children live in poverty, compared to 18.5% statewide. The Richland School District has 53% of 2015 students receiving free or reduced lunch, up from 51% in 2011. It is clear that many families with children are low income, which combined with geographic isolation, suggests greater need to be connected to community opportunities and positive resources to assist with family functioning, including financial management.|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
285|Community Wealth and Household Financial Stability (2019)|"Extensive local collaboration on the 2017 LIFE Report for Portage County has expanded recognition of the need for the community to continue to focus on financial stability and housing affordability in Portage County. These were key calls to action in the report that numerous leaders and knowledgeable people in the community will be collaborating to address. As a summary of these calls to action observes: more than a third of Portage County households struggle to afford basic necessities, and the number of households that report spending more than 30% of their income on housing has increased in recent years as rental rates have been rising. Ownership can be more affordable than renting in Portage County, and offers the benefits of building equity. Yet as indicated in the 2018 ALICE report for Wisconsin, ""that is only an option for those who can afford a down payment and real estate taxes and who qualify for a mortgage"". Costs of other basic needs have also risen substantially. Comparing the overall household survival budgets as estimated in the 2016 and 2018 United Way ALICE Reports for Wisconsin, the cost of basic needs for a family of four in Portage County has increased by roughly $7,000 over a two-year period (between 2014 and 2016). This represents an average annual growth rate of about 6% per year. Several community members are presently engaged in a series of meetings aimed at figuring out a way to address such concerns, and this group has acknowledged a need to learn more about existing models. Community-based development strategies for us to explore would include those that may help to hold down costs of living and expand opportunities for more people to gain financial stability."|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
286|Direct Education and Program Outreach|What's Going On Working to complete community needs assessments in both Columbia and Sauk counties, it is emerging that family dynamics within and across generations is a sociocultural hurdle within communities. Raising children, achieving adulthood, maturing successfully, aging with good health and moving through life with competence and confidence are key areas of struggle for most individuals consistently. What was developmentally true or expected of individuals in previous generations is not necessarily developmentally true of generations today. Extension programming will serve to help individuals to bridge this gap by providing educational programming that is timely, accessible, and up to date. Who Cares and Has a Stake The statewide situational statement conducted across the 72 counties in 2018 found 18 points of common challenge in 5 key themes around the state. Within each of these themes a human relationship-based solution has potential. If the interactions or, relationships, between people or groups of people could overcome these challenges then quality of life for all community members could potentially improve. State and local partners have a joint investment in solving these challenges to improve quality of life across Wisconsin for all residents. As a Columbia & Sauk County Extension educator I will participate in and facilitate the building of coalitions locally to problem solve individual and group challenges to human relationships in daily community life. How was this identified Nationally, the social and cultural issues we face in Wisconsin are evident across our country. The World Health Organization (WHO)'s action plan through 2020 has amongst its four primary goals to, 1) implement strategies for promotion and prevention in mental health, and 2) to strengthen information systems, evidence and research for mental health. As an Extension educator I can support these national goals through outreach with key community partners to advocate for developmental needs of all residents across the human life span, to keep the integration of ACES/ Trauma Informed programming central to the work undertaken, and to help guide the use of resources effectively and efficiently so that the needs are directed at the right issues at the right time.|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0
287|Leadership Development (2019)|"Demographic changes in Green County has resulted in identified need to build leadership and increase community engagement across generations. This need arises in multiple community plans and is expressed by business, local government, and community leaders. It is of particular concern because many of the current business, government, and community leaders are older. For these reasons, it's important to build leadership skills among younger leaders to ""deepen"" the leadership bench in Green County. At the same time, demographic data indicates that Green County is aging and becoming more racially diverse."|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
288|Improved Health for Richland County Youth & Families|Residents of Richland County face several health challenges. According to the data collected in the 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment, the top health needs are: Substance abuse prevention & treatment, Overweight/obesity prevention & treatment, and Mental health care. Coalitions to address health needs allows for resources to be leveraged and to avoid service duplication. The high overweight/obesity rate (1 in 3 adults) led to the creation of the Richland Fitness in Total (FIT) coalition in 2011. I serve in a leadership role as coalition co-chair and participant in the Healthy Wisconsin Leadership Institute. For Substance Abuse Prevention, the Richland County Children and Families Advocacy Council is a nonprofit coalition well positioned to take on the challenge, but requires support in data analysis, planning, leadership development, and evaluation. Additionally, I can offer educational programming to build the metal resilience and coping skills of residents, including the Raising a Thinking Child parenting program.|1|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
289|Extension Responds to Farm Businesses' Economic Challenges|Due to ongoing economic conditions in agriculture, many farms are facing significant financial challenges, resulting in questions regarding the viability of the businesses. Based on the Economic Research Service's latest farm income forecast, farm income has now been in general decline for 4 years and seems to be headed for a fifth in 2019. The downturn has clearly started to take a toll, financially and mentally for many farms, farm families and rural communities which depend on agriculture. Farms are experiencing challenges in their ability to successfully transfer the business to the next generation, and others will need to consider an exit strategy, and off-farm employment. At the same time, UW-Extension currently faces the challenge of bringing a number of new educators on board with the organization. Many educators come to UW-Extension with a formal education and professional experience in their field (for example, production agriculture). However, working with farmers, farm families, and rural communities, given current challenges, can involve difficult and emotional conversations, which Extension educators may have little experience or training.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
290|Addressing Leadership and Organizational Development Challenges|This program was prioritized based on the continued need to raise the majority of my salary and benefits from sources outside of the UW-Madison Division of Extension's budget (with grants, contracts and fees for educational services). This is my 15th year operating within this type of budgeting plan. In 1999, UW-Extension began working with urban neighborhoods adjacent to downtown Waukesha. Current efforts sponsored by Greater Milwaukee Foundation support outreach in Dunbar Oaks, located directly south and Tower Hill, directly west. These are Middle Neighborhoods: affordable, racial/socioeconomically diverse and on the edge of growth or decline. Both neighborhoods' land use is primarily affordable single and multifamily housing options. This location is within walking distance to the downtown riverwalk, parks, schools, numerous eating and drinking places, professional services and retail establishments. These neighborhoods have the youngest median age group in the county with over 50% low -to-moderate income households and older housing stock in established neighborhoods with many amenities. Key issues in the focus areas include the deterioration of affordable housing stock and the lack of a formalized Community Development Corporation to lead/sustain revitalization efforts with these low-income, underserved and distressed neighborhoods. This targeted area that has the largest concentration of housing built before 1960 in Waukesha County. Through neighborhood outreach efforts, housing maintenance and curb appeal improvement are continually identified as key issues to address. To retain and improve this existing housing stock, and influence new housing in-fill, a collective effort is needed with a focus on neighborhood housing.Community Development Educaotrs will pursue a collective effort that engages community partners to connect homeowners with housing resources to help them improve the physical conditions of their homes and strengthen Neighborhood Leadership/Organization Development to sustain quality of life neighborhood efforts.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
291|Master Gardener Program - A joint Waukesha/Milwaukee County Ext|The Master Gardener Program (MGP) was created in the early 1970's as a way for an extension educator to serve broader audiences' in obtaining answers to their gardening questions. The first records of MGP training in WI appear in the late 70's/early 80's. Since that time, the program has expanded beyond diagnostic services. Today's Master Gardener volunteer activities include establishing native environments and protecting valuable pollinator areas; participating in beautification projects in communities, parks and business districts to aid in placemaking; partnering with our FoodWIse educators to educate low income families on how to grow food; giving educational public presentations on various gardening topics; planting and maintaining gardens that demonstrate science-based gardening recommendations; and doing horticultural therapy-type programming in conjunction with health care, correctional, educational facilities. County MG program coordinators (educators) recruit community members as volunteers, train individuals to increase their capacity on a topic (horticulture), and leverage volunteer efforts to address our educational priorities.To achieve success in this program, educators:Recruit and train volunteers to increase their capacity in addressing horticultural related issues on behalf of UWEX. Support volunteers and leverage their efforts via volunteer development principles, developing community partnerships, and creating/approving projects to assist UWEX address our educational priorities. On a local level, Milwaukee and Waukesha counties have worked together to offer the master gardener program. This two county program ignores county borders and provides training and volunteer opportunities in both counties giving master gardeners the option to choose the location that is convenient for them. Both the Milwaukee County Extension Horticulture Educator and the Waukesha County Extension Horticulture Educator co-lead the program. In addition, all program records and MG support staff are employed and housed in the Milwaukee County Extension office. In January of 2018, the Milwaukee County Horticulture Educator retired. At that time, it was arranged that I would coordinate the MG program in both counties until the Milwaukee County horticulture educator position was refilled. Position descriptions were developed for Milwaukee, Racine, and Waukesha Extension Horticulture Educators. Two new positions serving all three counties were agreed upon. One position would coordinate the Master Gardener program in Racine and Kenosha and co-coordinate with me for the Waukesha/Milwaukee County MG program. The other would be a horticulture outreach specialist position and would serve Racine, Kenosha, and Milwaukee counties.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
292|The Next 20K Woodland Owners (2019-2023)|Leading the nation in paper production and wood furniture manufacturing, Wisconsin's $24.7 billion forest products industry provides 64,000 jobs, and employee compensation adds another $6.4 billion to local economies. Many communities depend on a sustainable forest products industry. As harvesting from industry-owned land decreased, to ensure a continuous timber supply the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) looks toward those who own nearly 70% of the 16 million acres of forested land   private woodland owners.Traditionally only a small percentage of woodland owners participate in learning events, and only about 25% have a management plan for their forests. Of these, 16% turned to extension for advice and Cooperative Extension is taking up the task of identifying and reaching those among the state's estimated 414,000 non-industrial private forest landowners who are seeking technical assistance to manage and transfer their woodlands to the next generation with active management on the 6,197,990 family-owned acres yet to be covered (DNR, 2013).|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
293|Master Naturalist Program Growth 2019|The Wisconsin Master Naturalist Program is a growing network of well-informed citizens dedicated to conservation, education and service within their communities. The program is entering its seventh season and the growth of volunteers, instructors and partner growth is becoming exponential. In six short years, 868 individuals have taken the volunteer training course and115 instructors representing 51 organizations are trained Master Naturalist instructors. The Master Naturalist Volunteer Training Course provides 40 hours of coursework in natural history, interpretation, and conservation stewardship from partner organizations throughout the state. Wisconsin Master Naturalist volunteers perform at least 40 hours of volunteer service each year and receive 8 hours of additional training each year to maintain certification. From 2013-2018, over 80,376 service hours were self-reported representing a value of $1.98 million.  The current website and on-line volunteer management system need to be upgraded to meet the needs of volunteers, instructors and the program. With the integration of Extension within UW Madison, there is a need to create a consistent mechanism for managing volunteers at an Extension level. The program has grown to include aspects that were not part of the first curriculum. The curriculum needs to be updated and revised on a rotational basis.  Volunteers report 2-3 times that amount of required hours for advanced training. This demonstrates a need and desire for additional understanding of Wisconsin's natural resources and stewardship of our precious resources.|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
294|Community Engaged Leadership: Emphasis on Youth Leadership #2|Youth leadership development programs provide skill development and the opportunity to apply applying learned leadership skills. University of Illinois Extension (Diaz et al, 2015) has identified six action areas where youth leaders develop competency in 4-H Youth Development: 1) planning, 2) promoting, 3) teaching, 4) mentoring, 5) advocating, and 6) advising. Program examples and outcomes in each of these six areas were highlighted in a 2016 Wisconsin 4-H impact report: https://fyi.uwex.edu/4h/files/2014/06/2016-Wisconsin-4-H-Foundational-Topics-Report.pdfThe 2010 Wisconsin 4-H Youth Leadership study found that all older 4-H youth demonstrated individual growth in life skills, youth participating in the program's intentional leadership practices (club officers, committee members, camp counselors, leadership training workshop participants, teen court panelists, etc.) had more opportunities in group and teamwork development. Intentional leadership activities give many opportunities to lead and work with both youth and adults. The study identified key program practices that contributed to leadership skill development, including: - Youth are working on meaningful issues and have significant responsibilities- Program structure provides a scaffold for youth leadership- Shared vision and commitment fosters teamwork- Youth/adult partnershipThe strongest outcomes in the 2010 Wisconsin 4-H study were in community connectedness and self-efficacy (beliefs about one's capabilities to produce effects). The strongest skill outcomes were related to communication, decision-making and problem-solving skills.In 2018, Polk County had 308 teens in grades 7-13 participating in the 4-H Community Club program. These teen leaders have opportunities to expand their leadership skills and practice through being: Club Officers, Youth Representatives on the 4-H Leaders Federation Board, club and county committee members and chairs, 4-H Ambassadors, Camp Counselors, Junior Directors, and experiences beyond the county. Helping youth connect with these opportunities and experiences is key to their gaining the necessary skills for mastery and leadership competencies.|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0
295|Financial Capability for Families and Community Agencies|Poverty and financial instability is a key source of stress in Bayfield County for families and individuals. The percent of children in poverty in the county is 22% compared with a statewide rate of 16%. (County Health Rankings and Roadmaps). The region faces the challenges of a rural economy with few high paying jobs. According to the Dec 2018 WI Dept of Workforce Development report, Bayfield County had the highest unemployment rate among counties in the state. Median household income is $50,110, compared to the state median of $56,759. According to the MIT Living Wage Calculator a Bayfield County family of two children and two working adults must earn $64,788 annually to meet basic living expenses without assistance programs. A single parent must earn over $59,056. These wages are well above median earnings and the wages offered in the typical service industry, hospitality, farming and support positions most commonly available in the county. Many financially stressed families face difficult decisions in trying to prioritize bills and extend limited resources to meet monthly expenses. Sometimes, without adequate information, poor decisions can lead to costly additional expenses and consequences, such as utility disconnect/reconnect fines, late payment fees, and high interest resulting from poor credit. Without careful planning families and individuals sometimes rely on payday loans and other high-cost lending options, spending extremely high amounts on interest. These extra financial burdens compound an already challenging situation. In addition, some families and individuals are unaware of community resources to help or may feel a stigma in accessing resources. Financial education can help provide families and the agencies that serve them with information to make informed decisions. This can help extend limited resources while reducing the excess costs of fines, fees, high-cost lending and other expenses. It can also empower individuals to set their own financial goals and work toward them through realistic steps with the support of an educator or financial coach. Bayfield County Human Development & Relationships programming is framed around the Center for Study of Social Policy's Strengthening Families Protective Factors: These five factors: Parental Resilience, Social Connections, Social Emotional Skills, Parenting Knowledge and Concrete Support in Times of Need are shown to enhance child development and reduce the likelihood of child maltreatment. They are also important to the well-being of all families, not just those at risk. Financial education contributes to two of these five factors: Parental Resilience and Concrete Support in Times of Need.|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0
296|Community Engaged Leadership: Emphasis on Service and Service L|Through service, individuals and groups in 4-H Youth Development contribute to the community now and build the skills, habits, and relationships to continue to contribute in the future.Service is an important way in which individuals and groups in 4-H Youth Development build positive skills and habits, connect to others in their communities, and learn about the needs of others in their communities. If designed intentionally, community service can be connected to other projects to create opportunities for application and deeper learning. Creating opportunities for youth to determine issues, plan responses, carry out a project, and reflect on their experience can more community service into service-learning. Community service and service-learning can also contribute to community youth development - the ongoing growth process in which all youth are engaged in building their own skills and finding value within their communities.Local situation: In Juneau County there are two very active after school programs. The Positive Youth Development Educator has met with the oversight boards of each. It was deduced that the after school directors have little time to put the effort into connecting the youth in their programs with service learning projects. They are looking for guidance and assistance in doing this outreach with their students and would like to develop a model. This model would be most helpful to them if it would include students doing service learning work during their afterschool enrichment time on an ongoing basis. This chart is another representation of this continuum and can be used to assess current service efforts and consider how to strengthen them. Community Service Service-Learning Community Youth Development Do for others Do for others and yourself Do with others Help solve problems Identify problems youth are passionate about Have input into the roots of problems Feel good about your work Apply and deepen skills Learn something new Short-term projects Connect to 4-H projects Stay involved Help people Learn from people Build connections with people Help the community Help the community Get connected to the community|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1
297|Wellbeing Program Development and Facilitation (2019)|The United Nations measures the Human Development Index which captures human progress combining information on people's health, education, and income. Yet, the simplicity of the HDI leaves much unsaid, and despite progress, large pockets of poverty, exclusion, and inequality exist. The United States HDI is a .924, however, when inequalities, like health, education, poverty, and having a voice are factored in, the score drops to .796 (Human Development Report, 2016). The State Wellbeing Score measures each states wellbeing, looking at purpose, social, financial, community, and physical wellbeing. Wisconsin has a score of 62.4 (National Score is 61.7) placing at thirteenth out of the 50 states. While, Wisconsin measures well in this assessment, it places at 31st in both purpose and social wellbeing (Gallup Healthways Wellbeing Index 2015). The COMPASS Now Report, a community health and wellbeing assessment facilitated by Great Rivers United Way for La Crosse County and five surrounding counties, indicated that the five top issues La Crosse County faces are: a need for more livable wage jobs, increased access to mental health, increased inclusion of socially diverse people, decrease of alcohol and drug misuse and abuse, and improved wellbeing of children and youth (Gromoske, 2018).Through community assessments and informal interviews of strategic stakeholders in La Crosse County, ACEs (adverse childhood experiences) are a factor in many issues affecting wellbeing including health, life expectancy, education, relationships, mental health, substance abuse, and financial wellbeing (Centers for Disease Control, 2016). Not only is trauma history an important issue that affects wellbeing in La Crosse County, but historical trauma, cultural differences, and socioeconomic differences are also issues that affect wellbeing of all community members as well as participation in services, programming, and having a voice. Research has indicated that being culturally, trauma, and socially/emotionally responsive improve wellbeing, participation, and social emotional learning for all community members. Improving wellbeing has been researched at an individual level, looking at methods to improve resilience, decrease stress, and increase happiness (Lyubomirsky, 2013). Further, the United Nations promotes six pillars of human development: equity, sustainability, productivity, empowerment, cooperation, and security. Initiatives like the Full Frame Initiative, positive psychology like wholebeing, and cultural and trauma responsivity, combine the academic pillars with tools and skills to improve relationships, organizations, systems, and communities to shift their fundamental focus from fixing problems to fostering wellbeing and relationships and looking holistically at people, policy, and community.

298|Building Capacity in Local Justice Systems for a Family and Fut|"Buffalo and Pepin are adjacent, rural counties and share a combined total of a little more than 20,500 individuals living in 8,759 households (U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts estimates, July 1, 2016), spread across 1,004 square miles. In both counties, agricultural-related activity is the primary economic base. Statistics show that family composition is mixed, with a greater percentage of single-parent households, unmarried parents and stepfamilies, in comparison to two-parent households. (American Community Survey Profile Report: 2011-2015 5-year estimates). Racial/ethnic composition in Buffalo County is 97.7% white alone; Pepin 98.2%. Although a relatively small percentage, Latino is the predominant minority, and I have utilized partnerships for outreach to connect with Latina-led young families for parenting and relationship education. Alcohol abuse, illegal drug use and mental health are top concerns for residents across both counties. (Great Rivers United Way COMPASS NOW 2015 Survey; Buffalo County Community Needs Assessment, 2015; Pepin County Community Health Improvement Plan 2016-2020; Buffalo County Community Health Improvement Plan 2016-2020). According to the National Provider Identification Registry, there were no mental health care providers available in Buffalo County prior to 2015. There are now two part-time mental health providers available in Buffalo and Pepin counties, with a patient to provider ratio of 6,679:1, compared with the WI state average ideal patient to provider ratio of 623:1. The lack of access to mental health services is a problem for families and individuals.Both Buffalo and Pepin counties face a dramatic doubling (from 15% to 30%) of residents age 65 and older by the year 2035. A need to prepare aging-friendly communities has been expressed among local government and agency partners, and will be a part of future programming planning. (This may become a secondary programming priority).Median household income is $50,196 and $49,516 for Buffalo and Pepin counties respectively. However, there are wide disparities between age groups, ranging from $16,917 for younger adults to $63,182 for seniors (U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts estimates, July 1, 2016). And, while unemployment rates are low, so are high-paying ""living wage"" jobs (livingwage.mit.edu, living wage calculator, 2017). Only 4% of Buffalo County respondents rated the availability of jobs with wages that offer a good standard of living; 74% responded poor or fair (2015 United Way: Buffalo County Random Household Survey). The percentage of high-paying jobs is low and a high household income is not enjoyed by most residents. The UW-Extension 2018 Developmental Situational Analysis process for Area 9 identified AODA and health concerns, and building skills for healthy family relationships, stability and well-being as two of the top five priority needs. This was based on a broad representation of stakeholder/partner input and surveys, and is consistent with results of a 2010 formal Survey of Issues and Themes Impacting WI Families and Communities that I conducted with local partners, as part of a statewide Family Living Program effort. Responses from dozens of partners confirmed my programming focus on education and prevention for family relationships and financial security, especially for vulnerable populations. Local Community Health Improvement Plans, United Way Community Assessments and Youth Risk Behavior Survey data continue to validate these programming priorities.I hold a leadership role within the Institute for Human Development and Relationships by chairing two state efforts: Healthy Relationships, and Correctional Systems Audiences. In order to make the greatest impacts at the local, regional or state levels, it is important that I leverage resources and be clear about my facilitating, research, education, planning and evaluation roles. Where possible, a prevention approach that reached a wide audience has been the foundation of programming efforts and, when necessary or appropriate, intervention strategies have been used. I rely on research and specialist support, as well as multiple sources for assessing current and future community needs. I advance a collective impact with partners and coalitions.Provide educational resources and opportunities about healthy couple, co-parenting and other family relationships parenting, child development, either direct education or contacts, online or through key partners."|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

300|Driftless Forest Network (2019)|Traditionally only a small percentage of woodland owners participate in learning events, and only about 25% have a management plan for their forests. Of these, 16% turned to extension for advice and Cooperative Extension is taking up the task of identifying and reaching those among the state's estimated 414,000 non-industrial private forest landowners who are seeking technical assistance to manage and transfer their woodlands to the next generation with active management on the 6,197,990 family-owned acres yet to be covered (DNR, 2013). It can not be under estimated that the majority of private land owners are managing their lands without professional conservation assistance. Landowners are dealing with daily decisions on activities in the management of their lands on an as needed basis. Very little long term planning has been attempted to guide decision making. When manipulating vegetation in complex natural ecological systems land owners need more information in order to properly manage and not degrade the environment. In order to provide a trusted source of conservation information to landowners, governmental agencies and private non-profits organizations have created a strong service related organization to assist land owners. This organization is called the Driftless Forest Network (DFN) and does business under the name MY Wisconsin Woods (MWW).|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
301|Capacity-building for Polk United and a flourishing Polk County|"Grounding of the work. The work planned in this document is grounded in theory at three levels: (1) at the comprehensive or ""grand"" theory level by ecological systems theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) and bioecological theory (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006); (2) at the domain-specific, evidence-based human services level by Walsh's (2003, 2016) family resilience framework; and (3) at the level of practical application by way of implementation science, which is based in large part on diffusion of innovation theory (e.g., Rogers, 1996). In describing work planned for 2019, I will tie in these three levels where appropriate. For more information, including a position paper describing this grounding, please contact me directly. Importantly, this work is grounded in the needs of Polk County residents and the organizations that serve them, subjects that are addressed below.County needs overview. Moving on to the context of my work, Polk County is a largely rural county in northwest Wisconsin with approximately 44,000 residents. Racially and ethnically, Polk County is not unlike others in the region in that the population is highly homogenous, with more than 95% of the population being white. Its population density is about half that of the state overall (45 residents/sq. mile vs. 90/sq. mile), and the county's largest towns Osceola, Amery, and St. Croix Falls have fewer than 3000 inhabitants. Eight school districts serve residents, with the largest enrolling only about 1800 K-12 students, and the smallest having fewer than 500 across all grades (WI DPI, 2018). A major east-west corridor, US Highway 8, divides the southern third of the county from the northern two-thirds. This split is not merely geographical; demographically, the residents of the northern section tend to suffer greater economic hardship than those in the southern part of the county. Overall, about 10% of the county's population is below the poverty line, and more than a third of county residents belong to the group of ""working poor,"" defined as being at or below ALICE levels (asset limited, income constrained, and employed; United Way, 2019). In several of the towns and rural areas north of Highway 8, the ALICE rate exceeds 50%. With respect to barriers to human flourishing, as in much of the region, Polk County residents suffer from high rates of mental health issues, obesity, and substance abuse. Mental health presents significant challenges for residents and the systems that support them; 23% of Polk residents report having experienced aspects of depression.Residents are more likely to be obese than the typical Wisconsinite (30% in Polk vs. 28% for the state)In 2017, Polk County had the singular distinction of topping the state's list of methamphetamine cases; substance abuse creates tremendous strain across criminal justice, healthcare, and human services systems. In other risk areas, nearly 15 % of teenagers report use of marijuana or non-prescribed drugs in the past 30 days. For alcohol, Polk County residents are more likely to report excessive drinking than the state average (24% vs. 23%).The county's three health systems, along with nonprofits such as United Way, the Mental Health Task Force of Polk County, and the Second Harvest Heartland, as well as the county's Community Service division (which houses the departments of Children & Families, Behavioral Health, and Public Health) are committed to increasing the well-being of Polk residents. They seek to achieve this through the workings of their individual organizations, but also through a county-wide coalition, Polk United. Organizational capacity is a critical issue for making progress against the three focus areas described above. In September of 2018, I was invited to participate in coalition, and then subsequently to join Polk United's executive committee. In October, working in consultation with Polk County's director of public health, I drafted a Statement of Work (SoW) that outlines Extension's planned capacity-building efforts related to Polk United. In November, the SoW was signed by representatives of Polk County administration and Extension. Key aspects of the SoW are included in this work plan; for a copy of the actual SoW, please ask me directly."|1|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

303|Connecting Horticulture Programming to Stakeholders with Extens|The Horticulture Outreach Program Manager position is a newly created position in the UW-Extension Next Generation model. As part of the process, the Horticulture Team along with Administration developed a RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted Informed) document. The process elucidated the following programmatic initiatives within horticulture programming in Wisconsin.  Educational Programming: Consumer or Commercial based educational programming that focuses on teaching the science of horticulture or principles to the audience. Diagnostics: The process of identifying or diagnosing plants and insects and related yard and garden problems at the county office level. Master Gardener Volunteer Program: Activities related to advising, coordinating and delivering the Master Gardener Volunteer Program. Community Programming: Programming for consumer audiences that uses horticulture as a vehicle to accomplish another goal such as community building, food security and personal development.Furthermore, as part of the process, it was identified that the Horticulture Outreach Program Manager would likely be accountable for ensuring state-level diagnostic initiatives in support of county-colleagues and Master Gardeners (in collaboration and cooperation with the Diagnostic Labs, and State Specialists), provide and coordinate training of current and new colleagues (i.e. liaison role for Horticulture-focused Educators), maintain the horticulture website, coordinate and compile statewide reporting, work with campus- and county-based colleagues in developing outreach materials, and provide colleague support and programmatic advocacy within the organization.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
304|Garden of Hope at the Vel R. Phillips Juvenile Justice Center|"Situation StatementFrom the 1990s on, critical job skills identified by employers have included a mix of soft skills and technological acumen. Research shows that cognitive skills like reading, writing and arithmetic and non-cognitive skills such as responsibility, independence, and initiative are important in predicting academic and employment success. These non-cognitive skills are also called ""enabling"", ""soft"", ""interpersonal"", ""applied"", ""workforce"", ""life"", ""knowledge economy"", ""career"", or ""21st Century"" skills depending on which sector is defining them (Garcia 2014). They also need to be independent, learn things on their own, and manage themselves without relying on others. Many students leave high school with the skills to work in jobs that are no longer available in our country. Only one third of graduating students are ready for college, yet in order to earn a decent wage, most will need at least some post-secondary education (Wagner 2008).The American Management Association (AMA), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are both national and international in focus. The Definition and Selection of Competencies Project, created by OECD (an organization of 30 industrialized nations) and the Partnership for 21st Century Skills (a group that is comprised of representatives from the business community, education leaders and policy makers) say it is critical for young people to develop 21st Century skills in order to function effectively in today's knowledge-focused economy (AMA 2015) (P21 2015) (OECD 2005).In an article from the Journal of Instructional Psychology, 13 job critical job skills were rated by numerous Fortune 500 companies, with survey response from 1970 and 1997 reported. Topping off the list for 1997 were: 1) teamwork, 2) problem solving, 3) interpersonal skills, 4) oral communication, and 5) listening (Cassel and Kolstad 1998).The 2010 American Management Association Critical Skills Survey Executive Summary reports ""employees need to think critically, solve problems, innovate, collaborate and communicate more effectively at every level within an organization."" (AMA 2010).A survey conducted by Pennsylvania State University in 1992 to 1993 identified the following qualifications as rating of top importance among 700 employers: oral and written communication skills, interpersonal skills, proficiency in field of study/technical competence, demonstrated ability for teamwork, and demonstrated leadership (Davis & Miller, 1996). A trend noted by Davis and Miller in their research is that businesses are relying more and more on people working in teams.More recent research has also shown teambuilding and communication skills to be of utmost importance to employers, along with problem-solving, decisiveness, and workflow prioritization (Adams, 2014). Ku generalizes the most sought after skills as fitting into three broad categories: life skills, literacy skills, and learning skills, and identifies three popular career tracks as computer systems analysis, computer software development, and civil engineering (Ku 2014). An article in U.S. News & World Report identifies seven skills employers are looking for; these are: social media literacy, critical thinking, sales experience, project management, writing, problem solving, and fluency in computer languages (Graves 2013).A key difference in the expectations of employers going forward revolves around literacy. For today's (and tomorrow's) employers, literacy no longer refers to one's ability to read and write, but also their ability to navigate online communication platforms. Today's youth are born into a world where technology is part of how they learn, communicate, and experience life (Ku 2014). Wisconsin Data: In Wisconsin, the Governor's office has established workforce development goals that serves as the basis for local/regional responses to economic development and workforce needs, including a plan for youth (Department of Workforce Development 2013). The soft skills/life skills previously identified align with the Governor's goals for Wisconsin's ""emerging workforce"" - youth (Western Wisconsin Workforce Development Board, Inc. 2014).Milwaukee County Data:The challenges that many individuals and families in Milwaukee face are complex, with roots in historical segregation and racism, generational poverty, low-quality educational systems and more. Many young people in Milwaukee's most distressed neighborhoods grow up with trauma as a daily reality due to violence, emotional and physical abuse, addiction, lack of support from parent/role model. Additionally, the public school system often does not prepare young people with the skills and/or confidence they need to identify and pursue post-secondary goals. The segregation and lack of understanding of/empathy towards other communities and cultures, as well as what is portrayed by the media, perpetuate stereotypes and misunderstandings that contribute to an overall sense of apathy and hopelessness for too many young people in Milwaukee. It is estimated that 33% of children in Milwaukee County live in households where income in the past 12 months was below poverty level, and 63% of children qualify for free or reduced lunch (www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/wisconsin/2015/measure/factors/24/data). 83% of children in Milwaukee Public Schools meet the federal qualifying standard to receive free or reduced lunch (http://mps.milwaukee.k12.wi.us/MPS-English/CFO/Bud...). Extreme disparities exist when comparing data from Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS) to data for the state. Students attending MPS schools are five times as likely to be truant. 62% of MPS students graduate in four years, compared to 89% at the state level. Of those 62%, only 57% go on to a two or four-year college, compared to 74% at the state level. 13% of teachers in MPS do not hold a license for their assignment, compared to 1.6% for the state. Only 3.5% of FTE in MPS have five or more years of experience, compared to 75.2% at the state level. The suspension rate in MPS is 13.6%, compared to 3.9% for the state. And of those 13.6%, only 59.1% of those that are eligible to return actually come back to school (wisedash.dpi.wi.gov/Dashboard/portalHome.jsp).Furthermore, the statistics around youth incarceration in Milwaukee County are startling. While overall juvenile arrests and incarceration in Wisconsin are declining, over 60% of the total number of incarcerated youth in the state come from Milwaukee County. 61% of the youth who were released from incarceration committed a new criminal offense within three years of release (youthjustice.org). A Community Needs Assessment (21 stakeholder interview, 4 focus groups with teens) conducted in 2018 revealed the following data/information:There are significant gaps in programming for young people between the ages of 18 and 24; most programming ends at age 18 or high school graduation, though many young people are not prepared to pursue post-secondary goals at that point and would benefit from continued programming/support.Young people want (and need) programming that focuses on social and emotional development (skills including communication, teamwork, responsible decision making, goal setting, critical thinking, etc.) and job skills. Young people want and need connections to both their own communities and communities outside of their neighborhoods; programming needs to expose young people to diverse experiences, people and post-secondary options.Strong and trusting youth-adult partnerships are critical to effect and impactful programming.Youth voice needs to be infused into program development and implementation.Resources and support around mental health need to be available for both young people and youth-serving staff alike.Greater resources and opportunities need to be dedicated to professional development and training for direct-service staff, including how to develop social and emotional skills through programming, mental health, positive communication, and self-care (particularly for staff)."|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0
305|Employee training and management programming for diversified or|Diversified Organic vegetable farmers are having a hard time attracting and retaining farm labor. While the exact causes of this situation are not known, contributing factors include: the seasonal nature of many vegetable farm jobs, low wages, farmer focus on production over labor management, reduced farmer interest in worker education/training in the last 15 to 20 years, and (likely) fluctuations in the overall economy. As farmers are feeling the stress of inadequate labor on the farm, they are more and more interested in improving their labor management skills. This information is taken from the FairShare CSA Coalition Annual Survey (completed by over 50 farms per year), the FairShare Grower Education Committee (6 to 8 farmers tasked with proposing educational programming for their farmer peers), ongoing program evaluation surveys, conversations with farmers, and the Area 18 Situational Analysis.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
306|Green Bay Ecosystem Modeling (2019)|While representing only ~7% of the surface area and ~1.4% of the volume of Lake Michigan, Green Bay receives approximately one-third of the total nutrient loading within the entire Lake Michigan basin. Hypereutrophic conditions have been a persistent feature of Green Bay throughout most of the last century and have been, along with PCB contamination of the lower Fox River, one of the principal criteria for the southern bay's designation by the International Joint Commission (IJC) as an Area of Concern. Although it has probably been a feature of the system for decades, the occurrence of hypoxia in Green Bay has only recently received attention with indications that it may be becoming more prolonged during summer monthsTo address hypoxia and other water quality concerns in Green Bay, land management practices in the contributing watersheds will need to change in order to reduce the amount of phosphorus and sediment entering the bay. Understanding how changes to land management practices, especially on agricultural lands, impact the delivery of phosphorus and sediment to the bay through the use of modeling is important to be able to demonstrate to land owners and conservation professionals how decisions on the land impact the water quality in the bay. On top of all that, climate changes will impact the effectiveness of management practices and the resulting water quality.|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
307|Resource Development for Extension Farm & Risk Management Progr|Due to ongoing economic conditions in agriculture, many farms are facing significant financial challenges, resulting in questions regarding the viability of the businesses. Based on the Economic Research Service's latest farm income forecast, farm income has now been in general decline for 4 years and seems to be headed for a fifth in 2019. The downturn has clearly started to take a toll, financially and mentally for many farms, farm families and rural communities which depend on agriculture. Farms are experiencing challenges in their ability to successfully transfer the business to the next generation, and others will need to consider an exit strategy, and off-farm employment. At the same time, UW-Extension currently faces the challenge of bringing a number of new educators on board with the organization. Many educators come to UW-Extension with a formal education and professional experience in their field (for example, production agriculture). However, working with farmers, farm families, and rural communities, given current challenges, can involve difficult and emotional conversations, which Extension educators may have little experience or training. The 2017 Agriculture Census report will be release in 2019. Ag Census data and information related to Agriculture's Economic Impact on Wisconsin's economy will be of interest by agriculture associations, farmers, rural communities, UW-Extension agriculture educators and agents. This information informs the agriculture industry and members of the public with regard to the importance of agriculture in the state. Extension has an important role in the development of the County Ag Economic Impact Reports.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
308|Food Business Entrepreneur Development (2019)|Dane County is regarded as a hub of food system innovation, with many organizations and municipalities addressing the many aspects of the system (e.g., production, aggregation/distribution, transportation, processing, marketing, waste management). Dane County Extension has played an important role in networking food system players, initiating new programs, and providing educational programming for gardeners and farmers. The Extension office has several educators engaged in food systems work. For this educator (community development) the central aspect of my food system programming is around food business entrepreneur development and ecosystem network building. Why entrepreneurship? Conway and Deller (Dept. of Agricultural & Applied Economics) document the importance of entrepreneurship in the Wisconsin economy in their analysis of sources of job growth (https://cced.ces.uwex.edu/eda-university-center/the-wisconsin-economy/sources-of-job-growth/). They find that small businesses generate a significant portion of job growth. Sole proprietor startups are the majority of new businesses, and these grow to generate jobs as they add employees. Communities that invest in and support entrepreneurship (through financing, educational programming, networking, mentoring) will benefit from vibrant community centers, job creation, innovation, and community appeal. Additionally, Conroy & Deller document that new business startups generate about 27% of new jobs in Wisconsin; however, startups have a high rate of failure - thus leading to job loss. Conroy & Deller (Wisconsin Small Business Survival Rates, https://cced.ces.uwex.edu/files/2018/11/0307-WI-Econ-Job-Growth-Factsheet-05.pdf , recommend that resources be invested in early stage businesses that have survived start-up turmoil (over 3 years old, and turning a profit). Entrepreneurship, as an engine of economic growth and job creation, is an important aspect of community economic development. But in Dane County, a county with well documented disparities in racial equity and justice, the goal should be inclusive and equitable community economic development. The food entrepreneurial sector is one where opportunity for inclusion experiences fewer barriers than in other economic sectors. Southern Wisconsin boasts a 'foodie culture' where consumers are interested in locally grown and processed foods, and also interested in culinary adventures. Immigrants and populations that experience structural barriers to ownership and advancement within traditional firms often have experience and skills in food preparation, as well as entrepreneurial characteristics (risk-taking, hard working). For these reasons, work in expanding opportunities for entrepreneurship in the food sector makes good sense.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
309|Connecting Forest County Youth to positive physical, social, an|Multiple layers of wellness choices make up a healthy life - healthy eating habits, physical fitness, positive social interactions and relationships, a healthy and balanced inner life, and the avoidance of risky behaviors. Each of these layers is connected to and impacts the others. For young people, the ability to maintain a healthy life is further influenced by internal beliefs and personal practices as well as their environment - the community, school and home in which they live.Social-Emotional HealthSuicide is the 2nd leading cause of death for young people ages 10-24 and the national suicide rate among all ages has been rising for more than a decade. For every suicide death in Wisconsin, there are 11 hospitalizations or emergency department visits for self-inflicted injuries. Wisconsin's teen and young adult population have the highest rates for self-inflicted injury. Statistics like these point to low social and emotional wellness among young people. A further concern is that many of the counties with the highest suicide rates coincide with those having the highest numbers of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs). Many of those counties are rural as well, just one of many indicators of a growing rural health disparity.According to the 2017 Wisconsin Youth Risk Behavior Survey, reports of electronic bullying are increasing - 16.6% in 2011 to 18.4% in 2017. Likewise, 27% of high school students reported feeling sad or hopeless for more than 2 weeks in a row, up from a low of 20.4% in 2009. On a local level, Forest County's 2018 YRBS data5 reports a significant higher number of youth feeling sad or helpless than the Wisconsin average. According to the report, 31% of youth reporting sad or hopeless for more than 2 weeks in a row, so much that they stopped doing some usual activities. This figure represents a 10% increase over the 2016 report.Alcohol, Tobacco and Other DrugsChallenges with high ACE scores and poor mental health have a significant impact on the choices young people make around alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. According to the Wisconsin Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), the smoking rate has decreased from 29% in 2005 to 11% in 2017. Similarly, the rate of marijuana use has also decreased from 7% in 2005 to 5% in 2017. However, a growing trend is the use of electronic vapor products, which was at 11% in 2017. Forest County's smoking rate has not decreased as significantly as the state of Wisconsin's average. In 2018, 18% of Forest County youth reported using tobacco within the past twelve months, a decrease from 20.2% in 2016. Additionally, our youth also report a higher rate of vaping with 26.1% of Forest County youth reporting that they have used a vaping product during the past 30 days. Youth rates of prescription drug misuse - an important precursor to use of street drugs like heroin also need to be addressed. According the 2018 YRBS 1 in 10 youth report having taken prescription pain medications differently than the doctor's recommendation. Marijuana use, also considered an important precursor to the use of street drugs and opioid abuse, is of concern in Forest County. In 2018, 31.3% of Forest County youth reported that they had tried marijuana, with 12.8 % of them trying it before the age of 15.|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
310|Pathways to the World of Work:  Emphasis on STEM|"When considering the importance of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, many reports speak of job opportunities and economic drivers in a global environment. Research strongly suggests that STEM educational initiatives are not just creating scientists and engineers, but producing STEM literate persons in all areas of the workforce. Eighty percent of the fastest growing occupations in the U.S. require STEM adequacy, and science and technology jobs are projected to grow by 20.6 percent through 2020, more than doubling the 10.1 percent overall U.S. labor force's projected growth . Amid the top ten fastest growing U.S. occupations are solar photovoltaic installers and wind turbine service technicians, five health care related roles, statisticians, software developers/applications, and mathematicians. The renewable energy positions top the list growing at an average of 100% in the 10 year period (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019). Despite gains over the last twenty years, females remain underrepresented in STEM careers, with the greatest disparities occurring in engineering, computer science, and the physical sciences (NSF Science & Engineering Indicators, 2016). The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that while women make up about half of the total U.S. college-educated workforce, they comprise only 29% of the science and engineering workforce (National Girls Collaborative Project, 2018). They constitute 39 percent of chemists and material scientists, 28 percent of environmental scientists and geoscientists, 16 percent of chemical engineers and just 12 percent of civil engineers (Camera, 2015). The reasons for the gender gap are believed to begin as early as grade school and are caused by stereotyping and unconscious biases which impact girls as they mature. As described in Forbes, ""Young girls are rarely encouraged to pursue math and science, which is problematic considering studies show a lack of belief in intellectual growth can actually inhibit it. In addition, there exists an unconscious bias that science and math are typically 'male' fields while humanities and arts are primarily 'female' fields, and these stereotypes further inhibit girls' likelihood of cultivating an interest in math and science."" This can be combatted by involving girls in hands-on science workshops, allowing them to directly interact female science professionals (as guest speakers/presenters), and increasing the visibility of females in science roles (Hughman, 2012). Better preparing youth, both male and female, for career paths is a growing priority among policy makers and educators. Though much of their effort remains focused on preparing high schoolers, middle school students are beginning to get some attention. As noted in a New America Blog Post, ""The middle grades are a crucial time to engage, or re-engage, students and put them on a path to college and career success. Research has demonstrated that grades, attendance, and engagement in middle school are strong predictors of high school graduation and postsecondary success (Garza & Swishe, 2017)."" A bipartisan bill presented on Capitol Hill in September, 2017, introduced the Middle STEP Act which was intended to expand technical education and career exploration programming to middle schools. The Act called for exposing middle school students to broad career fields and experiential or project-based instruction which may help them refine their high school course selection and start them on a more direct path to postsecondary studies. Essentially, how we think about career preparedness is shifting. In the words of America's Promise Alliance, ""How do we expect young people to dream if they don't know what they can dream about? Opportunities for career exploration give young people broader exposure to the working world they will one day enter. It helps them ""connect the dots"" between school and career in ways that keep them motivated to graduate with the skills they will need for the future"" (2019). As a mission mandate, the impacts of STEM educational programming within 4-H have been investigated. Hershberg et al. found that youth in 4-H science programs were nearly two times more likely to participate in science, engineering and computer technology programs during OST (Grades 10 - 12). Additionally, girls who participate in 4-H are two times more likely (Grade 10) and nearly three times more likely (Grade 12) to take part in science programs compared to girls in other OST activities . Other researchers state that STEM education within 4-H can improve science literacy and build problem solving skills .For more than a century, 4-H has engaged the nation's youth in the building blocks of economic success. This has meant a solid focus on agriculture science, electricity, mechanics, entrepreneurship, and natural sciences. Today, 4-H also offers opportunities in subjects like rocketry, robotics, renewable energy, and computer science. 4-H science, engineering, and technology programming is part of the long-term solution for improving science literacy and aptitude of America's youth. As a public-private partnership, 4-H can focus a variety of resources and expertise to strengthen young people's discovery and exploration of science (Science, Engineering, & Technology, 2012). The plan that follows is part of a multi-year effort to foster enthusiasm for STEM and science-related careers through deliberate community club and outreach activities.References:America's Promise Alliance.

Programs like Future Leaders Active in Government ( F.L.A.G.) provide an opportunity for students to participate in local government and civic engagement activities. F.L.A.G. members improve skills that enable civic engagement such as public speaking, leadership, teamwork and organizational skills. Research shows that civically engaged youth have improved social and school performance skills, greater self-confidence, reinforced ties with family and peers, reinforced moral values and integrity and compassion for others.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
312|Addressing Non-point Source Water Quality|Society has made tremendous progress reducing surface and groundwater pollution since passage of the Clean Water Act. In recent decades nonpoint source pollution from agricultural, urban, forested and other land uses remains the single largest cause of ongoing water quality problems. These problems manifest most commonly in Wisconsin as surface water algal blooms and sedimentation and in groundwater as elevated nitrates and other contaminants. These impacts have significant effects on public health, local economies and natural communities.Reducing the impacts on nonpoint source pollution through regulation is, by definition, problematic given the dispersed nature of the pollutants. Therefore, outreach and education plays a prominent role in alternate approaches. The Regional Natural Resources Program employs a variety of responses to this challenge, primarily through a contractual relationship with the Wisconsin DNR Nonpoint Source Program.|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
313|Woodland Owner Outreach (2019)|Leading the nation in paper production and wood furniture manufacturing, Wisconsin's $24.7 billion forest products industry provides 64,000 jobs, and employee compensation adds another $6.4 billion to local economies. Many communities depend on a sustainable forest products industry. As harvesting from industry-owned land decreased, to ensure a continuous timber supply the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) looks toward those who own nearly 70% of the 16 million acres of forested land   private woodland owners.Traditionally only a small percentage of woodland owners participate in learning events, and only about 25% have a management plan for their forests. Of these, 16% turned to extension for advice and Cooperative Extension is taking up the task of identifying and reaching those among the state's estimated 414,000 non-industrial private forest landowners who are seeking technical assistance to manage and transfer their woodlands to the next generation with active management on the 6,197,990 family-owned acres yet to be covered (DNR, 2013).|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

Eighty percent of the fastest growing occupations in the U.S. require STEM adequacy, and science and technology jobs are projected to grow by 20.6 percent through 2020, more than doubling the 10.1 percent overall U.S. labor force's projected growth (Beatty, National Research Council Committee on Highly Successful Schools or Programs for K-12 STEM Education, National Research Council Board on Science Education, & National Research Council Center for Education, 2011). Additionally, in middle-skill jobs (jobs that require more than a high school diploma, but less than a four year degree), over 67% of openings require, at a minimum, proficiency in productivity software such as Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word and typically other digital literacy skills (Burning Glass Technologies, Captial One, 2015). Overall, it seems clear that middle-skills work has shifted decisively and is now digitally intensive.As a mission mandate, the impacts of STEM educational programming within 4-H have been investigated. Hershberg et al. found that youth in 4-H science programs were nearly two times more likely to participate in science, engineering and computer technology programs during OST (Grades 10 - 12). Additionally, girls who participate in 4-H are two times more likely (Grade 10) and nearly three times more likely (Grade 12) to take part in science programs compared to girls in other OST activities (Hershberg, DeSouza, Warren, Lerner, & Lerner, 2014). Other researchers state that STEM education within 4-H can improve science literacy (Smith, Heck, & Worker, 2012) and build problem solving skills (Daniels et al., 2013).|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1
315|Providing countywide rural drinking water testing and education|A clean and dependable supply of water is necessary to maintain a high quality of life and strong economy in Columbia County. Groundwater is particularly important since it serves as the primary source of water for the residents and many industries in Columbia County. Because we cannot see groundwater it is important that we pay extra attention to this resource if we are to ensure that the quantity and quality of groundwater is maintained for our future needs. The luxury of quality drinking water is something that many of us commonly take for granted. Municipal and other public water supplies are subject to strict guidelines and water quality testing to ensure that the water meets current drinking water standards and is safe to drink. However, there are also over 900,000 private wells which serve as the primary water supply for a large number of people throughout Wisconsin, which are not required to be tested or treated. Determining the safety of private water supplies is the responsibility of the individual homeowner. Groundwater is vulnerable and if it is not carefully monitored, managed, and protected has the potential to be depleted or degraded. While much has been done to protect our groundwater supply we increasingly face the question of how to improve groundwater quality. Wide-spread land-use activities have resulted in elevated concentrations of contaminants such as nitrate and pesticides throughout the state, including Columbia County. Cleaning up groundwater after it is contaminated has proven difficult and expensive; therefore it is beneficial to prevent groundwater from becoming contaminated in the first place. As a way to address the concerns of Columbia County residents regarding the quality of their drinking water supply, Columbia County UW-Extension, Land & Water Conservation and Health & Human Services in cooperation with the Center for Watershed Science and Education in Stevens Point conducted a number of drinking water testing programs with each town throughout the county. These programs offered community members an opportunity to learn about their individual water quality as well as groundwater basics and the overall groundwater quality in Columbia County.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
316|North Central Region Water Network|Water is fundamental to our ability to grow and thrive. As the human population grows, water from drinking and fishing to farming and industry is under pressure. Water-related issues are interconnected and regional in nature, making strengthening networks and sharing expertise across states and sectors critical. Land-grant universities, with sound science and effective outreach and engagement, are uniquely positioned to help individuals, businesses, organizations, and communities adapt in the face of complexity and change. A substantial body of research demonstrates that strengthening networks and learning within networks can increase the ability of complex systems to adapt more quickly and in positive ways.By working together as a network of extension programs across the North Central Region was are able to pool our resources and coordinate our efforts to tackle complex water-related issues like water allocation, hypoxic zones and non-point source pollution. Moreover, by working together we can increase the capacity of extension educators and researchers in each state and across the region to address water issues by connecting them to professional networks that include expertise from multiple states, disciplines, and sectors, while diversifying our funding sources and building strong multidisciplinary teams who can work in side-by-side with leading federal, state and private partners.Rebecca Power, Anne Nardi, and Amber Mase provide primary support forthe North Central Region Water Network, with Rebecca Power coordinating andproviding overall programmatic leadership; Anne Nardi providing communicationand marketing strategy, coordination and and delivery; and Amber Mase providingevaluation services.|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
317|Equity Program Planning, Training, and Facilitation (2019)|The United Nations measures the Human Development Index which captures human progress combining information on people's health, education, and income. Yet, the simplicity of the HDI leaves much unsaid, and despite progress, large pockets of poverty, exclusion, and inequality exist. The United States HDI is a .924, however, when inequalities, like health, education, poverty, and having a voice are factored in, the score drops to .796 (Human Development Report, 2016). The State Wellbeing Score measures each states wellbeing, looking at purpose, social, financial, community, and physical wellbeing. Wisconsin has a score of 62.4 (National Score is 61.7) placing at thirteenth out of the 50 states. While, Wisconsin measures well in this assessment, it places at 31st in both purpose and social wellbeing (Gallup Healthways Wellbeing Index 2015). The COMPASS Now Report, a community health and wellbeing assessment facilitated by Great Rivers United Way for La Crosse County and five surrounding counties, indicated that the five top issues La Crosse County faces are: a need for more livable wage jobs, increased access to mental health, increased inclusion of socially diverse people, decrease of alcohol and drug misuse and abuse, and improved wellbeing of children and youth (Gromoske, 2018).Through community assessments and informal interviews of strategic stakeholders in La Crosse County, ACEs (adverse childhood experiences) are a factor in many issues affecting wellbeing including health, life expectancy, education, relationships, mental health, substance abuse, and financial wellbeing (Centers for Disease Control, 2016). Not only is trauma history an important issue that affects wellbeing in La Crosse County, but historical trauma, cultural differences, and socioeconomic differences are also issues that affect wellbeing of all community members as well as participation in services, programming, and having a voice. Research has indicated that being culturally, trauma, and socially/emotionally responsive improve wellbeing, participation, and social emotional learning for all community members. In 2014, La Crosse County Juvenile Justice Arrest and Disproportionate Minority Contact Task Force indicated that La Crosse County has a higher juvenile arrest rate than the statewide average as well as like-sized counties, disproportionate minority contact factors are present in the juvenile justice system, a large range of discretion in the intervention options occurred at public schools, a lack of programs that could serve as arrest alternatives, and an indication that some arrests occurred so the students could receive assistance or programming that was not otherwise available without an arrest. Since that time, a system of care has been developed and implemented to work on the system, policies, and with individuals. One recommendation was to conduct a shared system-wide cultural competency training which was done with the partners on the Task Force. Training exists in the county through a variety of agencies, yet has not been done strategically, at wider system levels, within businesses and organizations, or for the general community.Improving wellbeing has been researched at an individual level, looking at methods to improve resilience, decrease stress, and increase happiness (Lyubomirsky, 2013). Further, the United Nations promotes six pillars of human development: equity, sustainability, productivity, empowerment, cooperation, and security. Initiatives like the Full Frame Initiative, positive psychology like wholebeing, and cultural and trauma responsivity, combine the academic pillars with tools and skills to improve relationships, organizations, systems, and communities to shift their fundamental focus from fixing problems to fostering wellbeing and relationships and looking holistically at people, policy, and community.

318|Expanding Access to Youth Programs in Shawano County |Demographically, the United States continues to grow more diverse and this demographic trend is even more apparent nationwide with the youth population (Chart 1).Chart 1 (Child Trends, 2016)Wisconsin's racial minority population increased 500 percent between 1970 and 2013 including significant increases in Latino/Hispanic, Black/African American and Asian populations (Gordon, 2016). Similarly, the growing number of foreign-born youth and families provide opportunities for 4-H youth development to grow its membership base and reach new audiences. In 1990, census figures showed the foreign-born population at about 121,500; in 2015, that number had increased to nearly 279,000. This represents an increase of 130% over the 25 year span (Long, Jones, & and Ewald, 2017). These audiences are historically underserved by 4-H Youth Development. Families and individuals may lack familiarity with 4-H (knowledge barrier) or unable to access 4-H programs by traditional means (organizational barrier). 4-H Youth Development can benefit by welcoming youth and volunteers from diverse backgrounds. As an organization, UW-Extension needs diversity in its staff, volunteers and learners to effectively participate in an intercultural and global world.The 4-H Community Club program had 29,912 youth (grades 5K-13) enrolled in 2017. Of those youth enrolled in 4-H Community Clubs, 94.7% identified as White (4-H Youth Development State Office, 2018). Given that Wisconsin's population is 86% White according to Census 2010, it is clear that the community club program does not reflect the state's demographic profile (United States Census Bureau, 2010).In 2017, 10,787 adults had been certified as 4-H Youth Development volunteers of those 97.1% of these adults self-identified as White (4-H Youth Development State Office, 2018).In addition to the 4-H Community Club, 4-H Youth Development in Wisconsin offers programs for youth that include 4-H Afterschool programs, in-school enrichment programs, and group educational experiences at camps, demonstrations, library programs and more. In 2017, 27,392 youth participated in these experiences across the state and 82.3% of these youth were identified as White (4-H Youth Development State Office, 2018). Although gains have been made in delivering educational programs to underserved youth through these types of modalities, more effort must be made to provide racially and ethnically diverse 4-H participants with all the opportunities available through 4-H club programs, including staff support, awards, educational trips and scholarships.In April of 2016, National 4-H launched a new campaign aimed at rebranding 4-H as a strategy to increase the number of ethnically and racially diverse youth participating in the program. National 4-H has set their goal high. By 2025, 4-H wants to add 4 million new members and in so doing double the number of African American and Hispanic youth engaged in the program. This goal is especially pertinent in Wisconsin where the state's youth of color face extreme racial disparity across all measures of well-being and could benefit greatly from quality youth development programs. According to the 2016 KIDS COUNT Data Book, Wisconsin ranked 12th among the 50 states in overall child well-being, but persistent challenges hinder children living in immigrant families and children of color, especially African-American, Latinx and American Indian children (The Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2018; Kids Forward, 2018). Black children and American Indian children in Wisconsin are more than four times as likely to live in poverty as White non-Hispanic children, and Hispanic children are nearly three times as likely as White children (Kids Forward, 2018). In 2015, a 24/7 Wall Street Special Report listed Wisconsin as the worst state in the nation for Black Americans. Authors citied home ownership, unemployment, and incarceration rates as key indicators of extreme racial inequality (Frohlich, Sauter, & Stebbins, 2015). According to a 2002 study conducted at the Institute for Applied Research in Youth Development, Tufts University, researchers discovered that compared to their peers, youth involved in 4-H programs excel in several areas. 4-H Youth are: Four times more likely to make contributions to their communities (Grades 7-12); Two times more likely to be civically active (Grades 8-12);  Two times more likely to make healthier choices (Grade 7); Two times more likely to participate in Science, Engineering and Computer Technology programs during out-of-school time (Grades 10 - 12); and 4-H girls are two times more likely (Grade 10) and nearly three times more likely (Grade 12) to take part in science programs compared to girls in other out-of-school time activities (Tufts University).Adapting what works in 4-H Youth Development programming to the needs of emerging and underserved audiences is a major goal of the Expanding Access Team. We know from recent focus groups conducted with diverse stakeholders that parents are interested in these programs and willing to assist with programming in their communities. In April 2017, 4-H Youth Development was reviewed for Civil Rights Compliance by a team from NIFA-USDA (Hicks, 2017). The review was conducted to determine whether UWEX was complying with the provisions of the U.S. Civil Rights law and USDA's Civil Rights rules and regulations. The team found significant areas of improvement. Serious civil rights concerns include:  the ability to collect participant data inequitable access to participate in activities and opportunities supporting a diverse and inclusive volunteer base the absence of a strategic plan for expanding access the lack of a diverse and demographically representative advisory groupAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, Shawano County has a total area of 909 square miles, of which 893 square miles is land and 16 square miles is water. According to the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 2016, a total of 41,146 people live in Shawano County. Population growth for the nation outpaced the rate of growth for both the state of Wisconsin and Shawano County. During 2017, Shawano County's population decreased by 194 residents, or 0.5% (Demographic Services Center: Department of Administration). Of this population, 89.5% identify as white, 7.4% as Native American, 2.4% two/more races, .4% Asian, and .3% African American. This is concerning, as you look at our Community Club Enrollment demographics. 98% of our youth population identify as White, non-Hispanic. In a county that has 7.4% Native American population, we have less than 1% of our 4-H Community Club represented. People identifying as two or more races in the county is 2.4%, versus 2% in 4-H. However, at this time we do not have anyone identifying themselves as African American, Asian, or Pacific Islander. Shawano County hosts three Native American tribes: Ho Chunk, Stockbridge-Munsee, and Menominee. About 18% of our population is aged 0 - 19. Both access to care and educational opportunities are greatly impacted by the geographic location of residents; the more rural an individual lives, the more difficult it is to receive services. There is a need for educationally appropriate programming in safe environments. 74% of Shawano County is considered rural (Shawano Menominee County Community Health Assessment, 2014.) As you map out where the rural areas are, poverty overlaps, as well as needed services being located farther away. There are issues with transportation as well; even if able to offer an educational program at a community base, it is difficult to discern if people (especially youth) are able to attend without having transportation to get them back home. Couple this with more and more single-parent households, or dual working parent households, we are seeing more youth take care of themselves upon getting home from school, or seeking care from a grandparent or neighbor. The need for educational programming in a safe environment is wide-spread across the county and needed as a Protective Factor to make these youth as resilient as possible.

319|Community economic development understanding and improvement (2|The economy of Waushara is comprised of businesses with less the twenty employees. Much of business growth in the county is in business that have started up and expanded in the county. Water quantity and quality is a drive of two of the primary industries in the local economy, agriculture and tourism. Second home owners and Tourists visit the area for the quality lakes and the small town atmosphere. With the exception of Berlin that is in Green Lake and Waushara County, the communities in Waushara County have a population under 2,500. The population doubles when the second home owners and tourists visit. The retail mix is changing as dollar stores have located in all of the small communities' commercial districts.

320|Supporting Economic and Environmental Resiliency of Agriculture|Development poses a major threat to agriculture in Racine and Kenosha Counties, yet the coexistence of both within our county lines is considered to be one of the most unique and attractive aspects of living in the area. Despite the relentless pressure on farming in the area, there is still a significant amount of agricultural activity between the two counties, generating $751 million in economic activity in Kenosha County and $981 million in economic activity in Racine County (2014 Kenosha County Agriculture: Economic Impact; 2014 Racine County Agriculture: Economic Impact). Cash-grain farming is the largest contributor to ag-related economic activity and dairy production, though limited compared to the rest of the state, is also a significant driver. Both counties are home to successful agri-tourism destinations and farms selling their products direct to consumers living in SE Wisconsin and Northern Illinois. My work in Extension seeks to support the economic and environmental viability of all scales and forms of agriculture in the area through programming focused around farm succession, local food promotion, regenerative farming practices, agricultural farm financial management, and agriculture literacy & awareness.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
321|North Central Climate Collaborative|Our climate is changing and changes in climate have been a defining factor in agriculture and water quality within the North Central Region. Extreme weather events have the capacity to drastically impact our waterways, and climate variability creates shifts in crops, cropping seasons, and plant hardiness zones.Extension professionals play a key role in supporting farmers, natural resource managers, and communities by providing education, resources, and research to strengthen decision-making. Changes in climate continue to present challenges for both extension professionals and the clients they serve alike. In a survey of North Central ANR county extension professionals conducted in 2015, 54% had low capacity and an additional 38% had moderate capacity to adequately answer constituent's questions about climate change. There is a need within extension to build core competencies in the area of climate science, climate change, and its impacts on agriculture and communities in order for educators to engage stakeholders in discussing the realities of a changing climate and the adaptation strategies that need to be employed to ensure success.The North Central Climate Collaborative (NC3) is comprised of individuals with expertise in climate science, agronomy, and stormwater management, among other disciplines who is working to increase the flow and usability of climate information and increase the adoption of climate-smart practices on farms and in communities. The North Central Region Water Network provides funding support, strategic guidance, communication support, and evaluation support for the North Central Climate Collaborative, with Rebecca Power, Anne Nardi, and Amber Mase providing primary support.|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
322|Extension Response to Stress of Farms, Families and Rural Commu|Due to ongoing economic conditions in agriculture, many farms are facing significant financial challenges, resulting in questions regarding the viability of the businesses. Based on the Economic Research Service's latest farm income forecast, farm income has now been in general decline for 4 years and seems to be headed for a fifth in 2019. The downturn has clearly started to take a toll, financially and mentally for many farms, farm families and rural communities which depend on agriculture. Farms are experiencing challenges in their ability to successfully transfer the business to the next generation, and others will need to consider an exit strategy, and off-farm employment. At the same time, UW-Extension currently faces the challenge of bringing a number of new educators on board with the organization. Many educators come to UW-Extension with a formal education and professional experience in their field (for example, production agriculture). However, working with farmers, farm families, and rural communities, given current challenges, can involve difficult and emotional conversations, which Extension educators may have little experience or training.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
323|Organizational Development Programming in Washington County |Nonprofit organizations often provide vital services that enhance the quality of life of county residents, such as matching volunteers with elderly residents for transportation to medical appointments, providing positive role models and activities for youth, and protecting natural areas for the enjoyment of future generations. Nonprofits frequently experience increased demand for services while simultaneously experiencing weakening financial strength. Making a positive impact in a resource competitive environment requires nonprofit organizations to be innovative, dynamic, and interconnected. However, nonprofits often lack the knowledge and capacity to focus on their mission and use limited resources strategically. Organizational development program uses a variety of facilitated processes that align with the needs of the organization. Process tools will vary by organization and may include strategic planning, board development, visioning, and staff development. Providing education in organizational development (OD) was identified as the highest priority through a 2007 visioning session for the vacant Community Development Educator position and continues to be a programmatic need in Washington County, as measured in a 2017 needs assessment survey. Staff development is primarily achieved through the use of Real Colors personality instrument.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
324|Increasing Access to Quality 4-H Educational Programming (2019)|I would like to focus on strengthening the quality and access of our 4-H educational programming to our current 4-H members. The 4 Essential Elements of 4-H Positive Youth Development are belonging, mastery, independence, and generosity. From my knowledge of the community clubs (based on their charters, conversations with adults, youth, and leaders, and from visiting clubs), it appears that our community clubs are focusing on the essential elements of belonging and generosity. Clubs do community service activities, club celebrations, and occasional field trips. However, our volunteers could use support in strengthening the emphasis on independence and mastery. From conversations with youth, volunteers, and county staff our youth are not utilizing the 4-H project literature that is available. They feel that the project literature is either outdated or doesn't meet their needs. Online resources (like Pintrist) are said to be much easier to access and more relevant. Because few youth are utilizing the National 4-H curriculums, when a youth enrolls in a project their main resource is the project leaders. This is assuming there are club or countywide leaders in their project. Club leaders have shared that they have had a difficult time recruiting adults to be project leaders, despite the over 200 enrolled adult leaders registered on 4HOnline. Club leaders and parents have commented that adults who are listed as project leaders are not necessarily holding project meetings. Project leaders may view themselves as more of a contact for youth who have questions. In addition to strengthening the quality and access of our 4-H educational programming to our current 4-H members, I would like to increase access to 4-H educational programming to youth who are not currently in 4-H. Fond du Lac has a Hispanic or Latino population of 5.2%. This is the highest minority population in Fond du Lac County. Hispanic or Latino youth only make up 3% of the community club population and 27% of the short term participants. While the 27% is much higher than the 5.2%, these participants are not receiving the positive impact of having a year-long 4-H experience. Statewide Hispanics are 1.6% of WI 4-H's adult volunteer population, while Hispanics are 5.9% of WI's overall adult population. It is important that we do more to increase access to our programming to this relatively large population.|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1
325|2019 Capacity Building and Leadership with Waterways Organizati|ISSUE: Within the county there exists more than 300 lakes and hundreds of miles of rivers and streams. Thousands of people live along their shores. Most of the larger bodies of water are located in the northern portion of the county and have the highest levels of use for tourism which brings in some $13million. They are also the farthest from the county seat which has led to dissatisfaction by many riparian owners and town residents alike. The prevalent feeling is that County government has not dedicated enough resources or attention (law enforcement, regulatory staff, funding for equipment, education, leadership) to what many claim is paying the majority of taxes within the county. Additionally, there is only three Land Conservation staff with the responsibilities for water related programs regarding runoff, AIS control/mitigation, shoreline protection/restoration, agricultural site planning far less than the state's identified 12 people needed for the area. With greater use comes greater threats from AIS and pollution.INVOLVEMENT 25-30%: In 2016, the County Land Conservationist and members of his Land Conservation Committee (comprised of County Supervisors) approached the County UWEX Committee seeking assistance from Dale Mohr, the CRD Agent, in which to help design a countywide planning process that would identify key waterway issues within the county, facilitate in their prioritization working closely with residents of the county and then lead a strategizing effort designing a response to each that could either come from county public/private resources or those of other state agencies. In addition, the Village of Suring, in 2017, has sought out assistance from UWEX on providing leadership for reclaiming the North Branch of the Oconto River making it a tourism attraction, enhancing fishing and other recreational activities in an attempt to bring greater economic growth to the area. Each of the 30 lake associations/districts will be saving some $50,000 in planning costs if they had to rely on an outside consultant to design and conduct individual Lake Management Plans. One key outcome of this program will be individualized Lake Plans for them at no local costs, other than their many hours of volunteer time during lake monitoring and their participation in strategy development. Each group is expected to adopt all developed plans, local units of government will adopt as well.UWEX is expertly equipped at providing the facilitated steps in strategic planning and group consensus and design process while also having an extensive network of a variety of specialists to call upon regarding waterways and local government. Dale's past works with lake associations and their boards as well as local units of government will establish a foundation of trust and familiarity.EQUITY: Addressing these needs, I will be attempting to work towards a more equitable disbursement of county resources i.e., funding and staffing throughout the county. Even though the newly formed W-CAC group was successful in their presentations highlighting why the County Board should care about the county's waterways and why the northern lakes need resource protection, some would not agree that the funding allocated or the staff assigned should have been committed. This is somewhat a political issue with Supervisors. I do not take it lightly. Ultimately, with wise planning and good use of the resources given will go a long way in addressing their concerns or at least combating those at odds with the program. Not addressing these issues would unjustly continue a void in leadership and expertise in striving to keep and bring back healthy waters within the county and would undoubtedly cause local property owners and communities to spend lots of money to address key environmental concerns in the future. This project has brought in more than $350,000 from WDNR grants in three years, and has convinced County Supervisors to allocate $245,000 more. A Collective Impact Team made up of core individuals from UW-Stevens Point, UWEX, LCD, riparian owners, and WDNR have been working together and planning multi-year event, all of which would not have happened had the program not started. Along the North Branch of the Oconto River, some property owners see any improvement to their river as being a possible threat to their peace and security. More access and use means more people could harm their river or shoreline. I am hoping to bring property owners together with volunteers, sportsmen, local leadership to voice their concerns and facilitate a process to see if there are ways to alleviate concerns. Many people do not live within the county year-round. Gaining their insight and support in all water related matters is vitally important.

326|Continuing to Develop A High Quality Membership Program While E|Research shows that high quality membership programs are more likely to foster positive youth development outcomes. High quality programs are characterized by four key elements: (1) a safe, inclusive, and welcoming environment, (2) supportive and caring adults, (3) content that simultaneously challenges and sparks passion and interest, and (4) high levels of youth voice in program decision making. Together, these elements promote youth engagement by youth of all ethnic and racial backgrounds, and, in turn, the developmental and practical skills for youth to succeed. Regardless of the type of program (in-school, after-school, on-going, or sporadic), programs that focus on maximizing each of the high quality elements are more likely to be engaging for participants. These key elements are especially important for 4-H and Extension-based Positive Youth Development programs because each element is within the control of program educators and participants. The elements can change and improve over time. By monitoring and evaluating each of the key elements, program leaders can adapt and improve the program to maximize positive youth development outcomes for all participants. Research with 4-H members nationally has shown that programs that implement these elements contribute to positive youth development outcomes including: 1) academic motivation and success, 2) social competence, 3) personal standards, 4) contributions to others, 5) connections to others, and 6) personal responsibility. For the long term, these developmental outcomes will contribute to increased academic and vocational success, civic engagement, economic stability, and overall well-being.In addition, high quality membership programs must keep expanding access as a priority due to current changes in populations. Demographically, the United States continues to grow more diverse and this demographic trend is even more apparent nationwide with the youth population (Chart 1).Chart 1 (Child Trends, 2016)Wisconsin's racial minority population increased 500 percent between 1970 and 2013 including significant increases in Latino/Hispanic, Black/African American and Asian populations (Gordon, 2016). Similarly, the growing number of foreign-born youth and families provide opportunities for 4-H youth development to grow its membership base and reach new audiences. In 1990, census figures showed the foreign-born population at about 121,500; in 2015, that number had increased to nearly 279,000. This represents an increase of 130% over the 25 year span (Long, Jones, & and Ewald, 2017). These audiences are historically underserved by 4-H Youth Development. Families and individuals may lack familiarity with 4-H (knowledge barrier) or are unable to access 4-H programs by traditional means (organizational barrier). 4-H Youth Development can benefit by welcoming youth and volunteers from diverse backgrounds. As an organization, UW-Extension needs diversity in its staff, volunteers and learners to effectively participate in an intercultural and global world.The Wisconsin 4-H Community Club program had 29,912 youth (grades 5K-13) enrolled in 2017. Of those youth enrolled in 4-H Community Clubs, 94.7% identified as White. Given that Wisconsin's population is 86% White, according to Census 2010, it is clear that the Wisconsin 4-H community club program does not reflect the state's demographic profile. Likewise, in Columbia County, it is estimated that 92.7% of the population is White with 1.7% Black or African American, 3.4% Hispanic or Latino, 1.2% Two or More races, .7% American Indian and Alaska Native, .7% Asian, .1% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander (United States Census Bureau, 2010). Columbia County's 4-H Community club program is 99% White with just .01% membership in each of the other recorded ethnic groups which include Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Two or more races, American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander (4-H Youth Development State Office, 2018). Although gains have been made in delivering educational programs to underserved youth through the 4-H community club program in Columbia County, more effort must be made to provide racially and ethnically diverse youth participants with all the opportunities available through a high quality membership program. Columbia County positive youth development programs must expand to possibly include one or more of the following: afterschool programs, in-school enrichment programs, group educational experiences at camps, library programs, etc. This expansion is supported by a 2002 study conducted at the Institute for Applied Research in Youth Development, Tufts University. Researchers are Tufts University discovered that compared to their peers, youth involved in 4-H programs excel in several areas. 4-H Youth are:? Four times more likely to make contributions to their communities (Grades 7-12);? Two times more likely to be civically active (Grades 8-12); ? Two times more likely to make healthier choices (Grade 7);? Two times more likely to participate in Science, Engineering and Computer Technology programs during out-of-school time (Grades 10 - 12); and? 4-H girls are two times more likely (Grade 10) and nearly three times more likely (Grade 12) to take part in science programs compared to girls in other out-of-school time activities (Tufts University).Therefore, adapting what works in 4-H Youth Development programming to the needs of emerging and underserved audiences is a major goal for Expanding Access in Wisconsin. Stakeholder interviews have reported that parents are interested in these programs and willing to assist with programming in their communities.Finally, in April 2017, 4-H Youth Development was reviewed for Civil Rights Compliance by a team from NIFA-USDA (Hicks, 2017). The review was conducted to determine whether UWEX was complying with the provisions of the U.S. Civil Rights law and USDA's Civil Rights rules and regulations. The team found significant areas of improvement. Serious civil rights concerns include: ? the ability to collect participant data? inequitable access to participate in activities and opportunities? supporting a diverse and inclusive volunteer base? the absence of a strategic plan for expanding access? the lack of a diverse and demographically representative advisory group|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1
327|Parent Education & Trainings for Youth & Family Serving Profess|"Strong families are the building blocks of strong communities. Parenting, in particular, shapes the quality of a child's development and parent education can be instrumental in supporting children's developmental outcomes and parents' well-being. The National Parenting Education Network describes the goal of parent education as ""strengthening families by providing relevant, effective education and support and encouraging an optimal environment for the healthy growth and development of parents/caregivers and children."" Through various parent education programs and platforms, we are able to address the growing need for educational opportunities for parents and caregivers in our community. In addition, we know that children learn best when they are engaged in loving, nurturing relationships, and their primary learning occurs through every day experiences. Whether children are at home, with relatives or friends, or in childcare, the quality of early experiences is key to later school success. Social, emotional and intellectual learning are inextricably linked. Supportive relationships and healthy interactions actually shape brain circuits and lay a foundation for academic and developmental successes. Most young children spend some time in non-parental care. In fact infants and toddlers with employed mothers spend an average of 25 hours per week in child care, and 39% are in child care for 35 hours or more each week. In the Chippewa Valley, there are more than 5,400 children, under the age of six, in regulated child care settings (including certified or licensed home-based centers, group child care centers, Head Start and preschool programs, and half-day 4K programs). Although we have no way of knowing how many children are in informal child care settings (i.e., with family or friends), it is estimated that more than 70% of Wisconsin's young children are in some type of child care or early education programs outside of their homes. The quality of care arrangements, whether in formal or informal care is a key determinant of how well-prepared children are for school. One study found that children in high-quality child care had greater mathematical ability, thinking and attention skills, and fewer behavioral problems than those in lower quality care. This was true for children from a variety of family backgrounds, and there were more significant effects for children in lower-income families.It's also no question that recent trends in technology are changing the way that families interact, learn and build relationships. Infants, toddlers, and preschoolers are now growing up in environments saturated with a variety of traditional and new technologies, which they are adopting at increasing rates. 98% of homes with children under 8 have mobile devices according to a study from Common Sense Media. Although there has been much hope for the educational potential of interactive media for young children, accompanied by fears about their overuse during this crucial period of rapid brain development, research in this area still remains limited. With that said, more children, even in economically challenged households are using newer digital technologies, such as interactive and mobile media on a daily basis and continue to be the target of intense marketing. The American Academy of Pediatrics has recently addressed the influence of media on the health and development of children from 0 to 5 years of age, a time of critical brain development, building secure relationships, and establishing health behaviors. Through this research, the eParenting Little Ones team has been able to apply findings to current and future work around digital media. Research shows that digital media can be a useful means for providing education to parents and studies have found that online parenting education can be as effective as face-to-face settings in influencing positive parenting change. Today's average American spends almost nine hours per day using technology and owns four digital devices. Digital devices have proven to be a great equalizer, providing young adults, minorities, those with no college experience, and those with lower household income levels a connection to the Internet. In addition, the Family Needs Assessment that was conducted in 2015 showed that 63% of people in the Eau Claire community prefer receiving information related to their family through email. Only 22% reported interest in attending a class. Parents are digital consumers, as well, using mobile devices and social media to get parenting tips, interact with other parents and connect with their children. Parents of teens, in particular, often stay ""ahead of the curve"" by learning about new technology through their teen. Even although parents' access to and use of digital media is expanding, there are few high-quality, research-based resources that exist to provide parenting information and support. A key mission of UW-Extension is to reach parents where they live, work, and play. Digital technology has a strong potential to realize this goal. Online parenting resources can provide positive, widely accessible learning experiences and have the potential to increase connections between parents and other UW-Extension or community programming. To better meet the needs of all parents, the Digital Parenting workgroup, along with the eParenting High Tech Kids and eParenting Little Ones subcommittees have been addressing blog and video based initiatives to increase parents' knowledge, skills and support about and through digital media, leading to more effective and responsive parenting practices. This enhances the well-being of children and youth as well as creating safer and more productive communities for all.Eau Claire County is comprised of both urban and rural communities. With a population of 102,965, the county has 39,893 households and 26.4% of the population is under 18. Looking at the total Eau Claire County population, 92.4% is white, with 4.0% Asian, 1.1% African American, and 2.3% Hispanic or Latino. The number of residents who live in poverty[1] is 13.6%. While Eau Claire County is a resource rich community, many families are unable to access services. Many families who live in the rural areas of Eau Claire County find services non-existent in their communities and often lack transportation to the city of Eau Claire to access services. The findings from the visioning session and needs assessment completed in Eau Claire in 2013 and 2014 showed that the community was interested in ""empowering citizens to identify and address community problems through networking, coordination, prevention and collaboration across county lines and in urban and rural settings.""[1] https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045216/55035,00"|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0
328|Upham Woods- Environmental Education 2019 Statewide |"Upham Woods Director and Associate Professor Plan of Work Name: Robert Justin HoughamTitle: Director, Upham Woods; Associate ProfessorHome office: Upham WoodsTimeframe covered by the plan: 2019 Calendar YearAffiliate Team/Center/Program : Upham Woods Outdoor Learning CenterSituation Statement (it's okay to list two different situation statements)Overview of Upham Woods and Current TrajectoryBackground: Upham Woods Outdoor Learning Center is an informal science learning (ISL) center that is a part of the University of Wisconsin System, currently affiliated with UW-Extension (UWEX). Over the last four years, Upham Woods Outdoor Learning Center's increasingly vibrant outdoor classroom and dynamic statewide outreach program have strengthened the quality, diversity, and reach of environmental education in Wisconsin. Fast Facts:  Founded in 1941 318-acre facility Served 12,019 youth and adults in 2017 from 49 Wisconsin counties; served over 500,000 Wisconsinites since 1941 Programming includes:  on-site group visits from schools, 4-H programs, scouts, etc.  outreach learning experiences across the state Current Trajectory Established by Renewed Outreach Efforts and Use of Technology 2014-2018:   Over $1.92 million in cumulative program revenue generated Over $1.01 million investment in capital projects in collaboration with UWEX administration Acquisition of over $1.45 million in extramural support grants for building environmental education capacity and expanding access to programs at Upham Woods as well as to statewide environmental education opportunities, including Digital Observation Technology Skills (DOTS):  Framework developed at Upham Woods and used statewide for integrating modern, mobile technology into outdoor, experiential science educationo 11,990 youth and adults have used DOTS since 2014o Generates hands-on engagement with technology in the context of a classic outdoor learning settingo Digital tool kits are assembled, distributed and supported by Upham Woodso Resulted in 19 peer-reviewed articles authored or co-authored by Upham staff. Upham Woods programming reach has increased 28% in the last 4 years and revenue is up 15% in the same time period. Furthermore, our reach in 2017 was the largest in 32 years and our revenue is the highest in center history.Embracing Technology Rooted in Heritage of Upham WoodsWhen the University of Wisconsin received the donation of land that would become Upham Woods, Wakelin McNeel served as the Center's first superintendent. McNeel was also known as ""Ranger Mac"", a persona he created for a Wisconsin Public Radio show that he hosted. As part of his show, he invited youth and adults from all across Wisconsin to reflect on, observe, engage, and conserve the state's wonderful natural resources. On the program, he often noted that ""If you didn't take a walk yesterday, you missed out on many things that may not come again"" (Matkin-Rawn 2004). Today, we share these same sentiments with our students, encouraging them to observe their surroundings and ask questions that enable them to better understand the world they inhabit. While Ranger Mac worked at Upham Woods in the 1930s and 1940s, many parallels exist between his service to the state and the direction Upham is headed today. Ranger Mac used the technology of the era radio to connect a statewide audience to the environment. By using a resource that was both pervasive and accessible, he drew youth and adults to issues in our natural world and also enabled them to explore Upham Woods. Today, we accomplish these same objectives through the Digital Observation Technology Skills (DOTS) program and web-based resources. Ranger Mac's approach focused on observation and wonder in the outdoors. Today, we use terms such as informal science learning (ISL), inquiry-based instruction, project-based learning and place-based education to describe this same approach. Although there have been many changes in the last 76 years at Upham Woods, it continues to serve a crucial statewide presence in environmental education outreach by leveraging an effective blend of technology and youth development, within a context of vibrant natural resources and scenic beauty.Confidence in this Well-founded ApproachThe National Research Council's research shows that ISL is guided by student inquiry about the natural world, data collection related to their inquiry, and opportunities to present their findings to peers and community members (National Research Council, 2009). Further, the National Research Council states that informal learning environments are, in principle, accessible to all learners, and evidence suggests they have particular potential for supporting learners from non-dominant groups (National Research Council, 2009). In addition to providing experiential learning opportunities grounded in environmental concepts, ISL centers like Upham Woods expand the network of educators and facilitators engaged in environmental education and provide students with ""direct access to compelling phenomena in the natural world"" (National Science Foundation, 2011).While ISL centers, such as camps and nature centers, have historically had programming legacies rooted in the natural sciences, their educational practices can be in tension with the emphasis on the adoption of modern technology that often guides contemporary STEM education (Cuthbertson, Socha, & Potter, 2004). Yet using technology in outdoor education settings holds great promise in deepening scientific connections to local places through data collection. As an example, data collection within a context of location, community, and inquiry provides a place-based approach to education that contributes to active and engaged citizens (Hougham & Kerlin, 2016; Sobel, 2004). In modern science classrooms and careers, most scientific tools are digital. Consequently, adopting digital tools requires ISL centers to strike a careful balance between retaining the connection to place that outdoor, experiential learning promotes and serving youth and educators with modern STEM curricula. Connecting this further, place-based education like that promoted at Upham Woods has been shown to connect learners' STEM engagement to their experiences in informal settings, develop their acute observation skills, and increase their capacity to care about the environment around them (Land & Zimmerman, 2015; Greenwood & Hougham, 2015)."|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
329|Facilitating Systems Change Culturally  Minobimaadiziiwin|Situation StatementLac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians is located primarily in southwestern Vilas County with some of the reservation within Iron and Oneida County's. The tribal enrollment is approximately 4000 people with 2400 living on reservation. Being a federally recognized tribe and a sovereign nation this is a unique partnership for the University of Wisconsin Extension. The tribe is the largest employer within Vilas County with approximately 800 employees between the public and private sectors; however unemployment for tribal members is approximately 40%. Because of this there are organizational challenges that occur within the Tribe's structure. Issues such as staff conflicts, policy issues, standard operating procedures, needed action plans, customer service and communication issues can have a bearing on the overall services the tribe provides to their membership. What adds to this is the community is facing an illegal drug epidemic that has forced the tribe to declare a state of emergency. It is imperative that the tribe make sure all program services and processes run efficiently as possible to assist individuals in need and for the safety and well-being of the community as a whole. The Lac du Flambeau Tribe focusing on the 7th Generation is creating a vision of climate resiliency and food sovereignty. In order to move the vision of the community forward, possible external partners need to have a better understanding of tribal communities along with reviewing internal policies and processes in order to improve the quality of life in the community.The Lac du Flambeau Tribal Council would like to make sure that positive and constructive activities and initiatives continue to occur while dealing with the drug issues. To do this, programs need to come together to develop policy and action plans that move the community forward in a positive direction. There is also a need to continue to improve the infrastructure and appearance of the community to assist in developing a positive sense of place to improve the quality of life on the reservation. To create this sense of place, emphasis has been put on a next phase of downtown revitalization for the community. It must be noted that in order for the local CNRED Educator to assist with these issue an emphasis must be put on the ojibwe culture and the seven teachings combined with organizational development concepts. All issues must be looked at as connected within a circle and approached accordingly. One other issue that all Tribes in the Great Lakes region deal with is the lack of understanding tribal sovereignty and history. Because of this there are myths and misconception regarding tribal governments by surrounding communities, county and state agencies, educational institutes and citizens.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
330|Program #1  Research and Resources to Assist Local Business Dev|Extension education in community business development has a unique position between broader regional economic development and individual business development. It is often focused on a specific community and its trade area. Community business development directly impacts quality-of-life as measured by the availability of services, retail, workspaces, housing, and other commercial activities. Our learners are often interested in downtown revitalization, but are not necessarily limited to a downtown district, or a Main Street program area. One issue facing community business development efforts, especially in rural areas, has been the migration of retail and services to larger commercial centers of the state. In addition, significant changes are occurring in the retail sector that are challenging bricks and mortar stores in favor of online commerce. Even chain affiliated stores, located in malls and shopping centers, are facing challenges today. Many are reducing the size of their store footprints and closing stores in less profitable locations.This provides an opportunity for Extension to help community and business leaders understand the market and develop realistic scenarios for strengthening and expanding local businesses, while maintaining a focus on what's important to community residents. This is especially important in multicultural urban neighborhoods, and small rural communities that are underserved by grocery, pharmacy, medical and other essential services.Program #1-Research/Resources Research to identify characteristics of vibrant downtowns will continue through 2019. Working with Michael Burayidi, Professor of Urban Planning at Ball State University, two graduate students, and with guidance from Steve Deller, this project will explore differences between successful downtowns and all others in seven Midwestern states. Cities with populations between 25,000 and 75,000 will be studied. The work will hopefully result in a journal article that will help local planning professionals and business developers understand what variables may be associated with vibrant business districts. Understand housing market dynamics. Working with colleagues, I will refine our downtown housing analysis instructions on the DMA website. This will benefit bankers, developers, and others considering investments in new infill housing. I plan on contributing to the work group's white paper on Extensions current and future capacity to address housing issues. Creative Uses for Downtown Buildings. Building owners and business operators will learn how other properties have been profitably repurposed. Updates underway with possibility of submission to Extension Publications. Update the Directory of Downtown Development Resources at Universities. This project (originally funded by NCRCRD) will be updated so that Extension educators, nationwide, will have knowledge of other related programs in the US. Updates have not started yet. Updates to the Downtown and Business District Market Analysis Toolbox. This resource requires maintenance to be current and relevant to local analysts, planners, chambers and others. This work is well underway with updates to various sections. Journal article on our community-led approach to Market Analysis. This proposed article will explore effective teaching methods when using the UWEX market analysis tools.

333|Improving community through Menominee Language and Culture|"It is important to report on the current state of Menominee Language as it reinforces the immediate community needs. According to the Menominee Language and Culture Commission, the department responsible for language and culture preservation, it reported that of 9,000 enrolled tribal members, there are only six first language living speakers living and only 10 semi-functional speakers. This equates to only 0.001% of the entire Menominee tribal population being language speakers. Language and culture are highly valued in the community because they strengthen identity, increases affinity to community, and tie history to the present. Language preservation has been identified as a priority by the Menominee Tribal Legislature and is included in the Tribe's strategic plan. Those with language skills and cultural knowledge recognize the strength in this knowledge and recognize that language and culture are key to addressing public health rankings and community issues. Further, there is a movement within Indigenous communities that recognizes the value of Indigenous knowledge in community building. Unfortunately, there are not enough language speakers/learners to do all of the work that is needed. There are gaps not being addressed and more focus and resources are needed here. While the local need is important, the need for language work is strengthened by the Native Nations_UW Working Group. A recent strategic plan by the Native Nations_UW Working Group identified language as a strategic priority. As related to language, the strategic plan states, ""Strengthen UW educational opportunities to appreciate and understand Native Cultures, and to support efforts within Native communities in language and culture revitalization."" Failure to address the language needs of this community will have long-lasting impacts on the community."|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
334|Comprehensive Plan Implementation Among Municipalities in Shebo|"Because the Wisconsin Legislature's 1999 ""Smart Growth Law"" virtually mandated comprehensive plans to be adopted by cities, villages, and towns by 2010, all 28 communities in Sheboygan County currently have comprehensive plans adopted as ordinances. Each of these comprehensive plans contains dozens of recommended activities and must be updated at least once every 10 years. Since most of the communities in Sheboygan County lack planning staff or full-time elected officials, there is a real likelihood that plans will 1) ""sit on the shelf"" and not be implemented, 2) be implemented ineffectively, or 3) be implemented in a way that is not consistent with a community's plan, which in certain instances is contrary to state law. Further, plans are living documents that need to be amended from time to time, and there are ""best practices"" and a statutory process for doing so that few local officials have experience with.To make and/or keep local officials aware of these issues, this educator has held a local seminar on plan implementation (5/20/10), given a presentation on plan amendments at a Sheboygan County Heads of Local Government meeting (2/29/12), presented ""Using and Amending Your Comprehensive Plan"" on a state-wide Local Land Use Planning and Zoning WisLine moderated by Brian Ohm (1/11/12), spoken at a Wisconsin Towns Association - Sheboygan County chapter quarterly meeting (7/14/17), and led a discussion at a quarterly meeting of Sheboygan County municipal clerks (9/21/17) about the need for updating comprehensive plans. This educator has also been actively involved with several local communities on plan implementation and updating and has shared research and templates with CNRED colleagues and the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission.To meet the needs of area communities, it is anticipated that this educator will continue to work with local officials to inform and remind them of the need for plan implementation, consistency, and updates. Perhaps more importantly, this educator will continue to explain the ""how"" and ""why"" behind these activities and will facilitate prioritization efforts and provide educational tools to assist local governments in their efforts. Additionally, this educator will undertake research projects, as necessary, to help local communities determine the best way to achieve implementation success for particular plan recommendations."|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

336|Building Resilience in Polk County Individuals, Families, and C|"Grounding of the work. The work planned in this document is grounded in theory at three levels: (1) at the comprehensive or ""grand"" theory level, by ecological systems theory/bioecolological theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Bronfenbrenner & Murphy, 2006); (2) at the domain-specific, evidence-based human services level by Walsh's (2003, 2016) family resilience framework; and (3) at the level of practical application by way of implementation science, which is based in large part on diffusion of innovation theory (e.g., Rogers, 1996. County overview. Moving on to the geographical context of my work, Polk County is a largely rural county in northwest Wisconsin with approximately 44,000 residents. Racially and ethnically, Polk County is not unlike others in the region in that the population is highly homogenous, with more than 95% of the population being white. Its population density is about half that of the state overall (45 residents/sq. mile vs. 90/sq. mile), and the county's largest towns Osceola, Amery, and St. Croix Falls have fewer than 3000 inhabitants. Eight school districts serve residents, with the largest enrolling only about 1800 K-12 students, and the smallest having fewer than 500 across all grades (WI DPI, 2018). A major east-west corridor, US Highway 8, divides the southern third of the county from the northern two-thirds. This split is not merely geographical; demographically, the residents of the northern section tend to suffer greater economic hardship than those in the southern part of the county. Overall, about 10% of the county's population is below the poverty line, and more than a third of county residents belong to the group of ""working poor,"" defined as being at or below ALICE levels (asset limited, income constrained, and employed. In several of the towns and rural areas north of Highway 8, the ALICE rate exceeds 50%. Current efforts to improve the situation for Polk County residents frequently focus on pathologies and their elimination. For instance the work of Polk United--a county-wide coalition of healthcare providers, non-profits, educational institutions, and government--focuses its efforts on mental illness, substance abuse, and chronic disease. Recently, Polk United leadership has acknowledged that, while important, viewing the well-being of individuals, families, and communities through a disease-treatment lens presents an incomplete solution, and is in the process of examining how strengths-based approaches, such that offered by a resilience framework, augments the current pathologies approach. This project focuses on building resilience in Polk County individuals, families, and communities. From a theoretical perspective, a key aspect of resilience is enhancing social support networks for those impacted by stressors (CSSPS, 2019; Walsh, 2016). This workplan seeks to accomplish this through three sub-projects: Type Resilience Sub-projects/ComponentsCapacity-buildingResilience in the Face of Secondary Trauma - program to assist Polk County Division of Community Services and Polk United with caregivers'/professionals' secondary trauma; focus on strengthening the community of practitionersDirect serviceCommunity Cafes within Polk County on topics related to individual, family, and community resilience; focus on connecting individuals (parents, other caregivers) within Polk County to each other and necessary resourcesCapacity-building; direct serviceHybridized Parenting Support for fathers & co-parents consisting of online resources accompanied by mentoring support; primary purpose is developing parents' network of support"|1|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
337|Pathways to the World of Work: Emphasis on Life Skills|"National Data: From the 1990s on, critical job skills identified by employers have included a mix of soft skills and technological acumen. Research shows that cognitive skills like reading, writing and arithmetic and non-cognitive skills such as responsibility, independence, and initiative are important in predicting academic and employment success. These non-cognitive skills are also called ""enabling"", ""soft"", ""interpersonal"", ""applied"", ""workforce"", ""life"", ""knowledge economy"", ""career"", or ""21st Century"" skills depending on which sector is defining them (Garcia 2014). They also need to be independent, learn things on their own, and manage themselves without relying on others. Many students leave high school with the skills to work in jobs that are no longer available in our country. Only one third of graduating students are ready for college, yet in order to earn a decent wage, most will need at least some postsecondary education (Wagner 2008).The American Management Association (AMA), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are both national and international in focus. The Definition and Selection of Competencies Project, created by OECD (an organization of 30 industrialized nations) and the Partnership for 21st Century Skills (a group that is comprised of representatives from the business community, education leaders and policy makers) say it is critical for young people to develop 21st Century skills in order to function effectively in today's knowledge-focused economy (AMA 2015) (P21 2015) (OECD 2005).In an article from the Journal of Instructional Psychology, 13 job critical job skills were rated by numerous Fortune 500 companies, with survey response from 1970 and 1997 reported. Topping off the list for 1997 were: 1) teamwork, 2) problem solving, 3) interpersonal skills, 4) oral communication, and 5) listening (Cassel and Kolstad 1998).The 2010 American Management Association Critical Skills Survey Executive Summary reports ""employees need to think critically, solve problems, innovate, collaborate and communicate more effectively at every level within an organization."" (AMA 2010). A survey conducted by Pennsylvania State University in 1992 to 1993 identified the following qualifications as rating of top importance among 700 employers: oral and written communication skills, interpersonal skills, proficiency in field of study/technical competence, demonstrated ability for teamwork, and demonstrated leadership (Davis & Miller, 1996). A trend noted by Davis and Miller in their research is that businesses are relying more and more on people working in teams.More recent research has also shown teambuilding and communication skills to be of utmost importance to employers, along with problem-solving, decisiveness, and workflow prioritization (Adams, 2014). Ku generalizes the most sought after skills as fitting into three broad categories: life skills, literacy skills, and learning skills, and identifies three popular career tracks as computer systems analysis, computer software development, and civil engineering (Ku 2014). An article in U.S. News & World Report identifies seven skills employers are looking for; these are: social media literacy, critical thinking, sales experience, project management, writing, problem solving, and fluency in computer languages (Graves 2013).A key difference in the expectations of employers going forward revolves around literacy. For today's (and tomorrow's) employers, literacy no longer refers to one's ability to read and write, but also their ability to navigate online communication platforms. Today's youth are born into a world where technology is part of how they learn, communicate, and experience life (Ku 2014).Wisconsin Data: In Wisconsin, the Governor's office has established workforce development goals that serves as the basis for local/regional responses to economic development and workforce needs, including a plan for youth (Department of Workforce Development 2013). The soft skills/life skills previously identified align with the Governor's goals for Wisconsin's ""emerging workforce"" - youth (Western Wisconsin Workforce Development Board, Inc. 2014).4-H Data: Students gain many skills during school, which is typically a small part of their day. As an out-of-school-time program, 4-H Youth Development has been preparing youth for a successful future for years. With changes in the economy, types of available jobs and technology, 4-H Youth Development can make a valuable impact to successfully prepare youth for postsecondary education and future employment by being intentional about integrating workforce development skills in programs (Cochran et al 2010)."|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1
338|Expanding Access to Youth Through Gardening and Other Programmi|Demographically, the United States continues to grow more diverse and this demographic trend is even more apparent nationwide with the youth population.Wisconsin's racial minority population increased 500 percent between 1970 and 2013 including significant increases in Latino/Hispanic, Black/African American and Asian populations (Gordon, 2016). Similarly, the growing number of foreign-born youth and families provide opportunities for 4-H youth development to grow its membership base and reach new audiences. In 1990, census figures showed the foreign-born population at about 121,500; in 2015, that number had increased to nearly 279,000. This represents an increase of 130% over the 25 year span (Long, Jones, & and Ewald, 2017). These audiences are historically underserved by 4-H Youth Development. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, Wisconsin has just over 49,000 Hmong residents. Here in Portage County, Hmong residents represent our largest minority population with 1,955 residents in 2010; this is an increase of 28% over the 2000 Census data. The Hispanic/Latino population is the second-largest and the fastest-growing minority population in Portage County with a population of 1,853, representing 2.6% of the Portage County population an increase of 92% over the 2000 Census data. When comparing these data to the number of underserved and protected youth in the 4-H community clubs, the club program had little underserved and protected youth participants. The 4-H Community Club program had 29,912 youth (grades 5K-13) enrolled in 2017. Of those youth enrolled in 4-H Community Clubs, 94.7% identified as White (4-H Youth Development State Office, 2018). Given that Wisconsin's population is 86% White according to Census 2010, it is clear that the community club program does not reflect the state's demographic profile (United States Census Bureau, 2010).Families and individuals may lack familiarity with 4-H (knowledge barrier) or unable to access 4-H programs by traditional means (organizational barrier). 4-H Youth Development can benefit by welcoming youth and volunteers from diverse backgrounds. As an organization, UW-Extension needs diversity in its staff, volunteers and learners to effectively participate in an intercultural and global world.In addition to the 4-H Community Club, 4-H Youth Development in Wisconsin offers programs for youth that include 4-H Afterschool programs, in-school enrichment programs, and group educational experiences at camps, demonstrations, library programs and more. In 2017, 27,392 youth participated in these experiences across the state and 82.3% of these youth were identified as White (4-H Youth Development State Office, 2018). Although gains have been made in delivering educational programs to underserved youth through these types of modalities, more effort must be made to provide racially and ethnically diverse 4-H participants with all the opportunities available through 4-H club programs, including staff support, awards, educational trips and scholarships.In April of 2016, National 4-H launched a new campaign aimed at rebranding 4-H as a strategy to increase the number of ethnically and racially diverse youth participating in the program. National 4-H has set their goal high. By 2025, 4-H wants to add 4 million new members and in so doing double the number of African American and Hispanic youth engaged in the program.The 4-H Community Club program had 29,912 youth (grades 5K-13) enrolled in 2017. Of those youth enrolled in 4-H Community Clubs, 94.7% identified as White (4-H Youth Development State Office, 2018). Given that Wisconsin's population is 86% White according to Census 2010, it is clear that the community club program does not reflect the state's demographic profile (United States Census Bureau, 2010).According to a 2002 study conducted at the Institute for Applied Research in Youth Development, Tufts University, researchers discovered that compared to their peers, youth involved in 4-H programs excel in several areas. 4-H Youth are:? Four times more likely to make contributions to their communities (Grades 7-12);? Two times more likely to be civically active (Grades 8-12); ? Two times more likely to make healthier choices (Grade 7);? Two times more likely to participate in Science, Engineering and Computer Technology programs during out-of-school time (Grades 10 - 12); and? 4-H girls are two times more likely (Grade 10) and nearly three times more likely (Grade 12) to take part in science programs compared to girls in other out-of-school time activities (Tufts University).Adapting what works in 4-H Youth Development programming to the needs of emerging and underserved audiences is a major goal of the Expanding Access Team. We know from recent focus groups conducted with diverse stakeholders that parents are interested in these programs and willing to assist with programming in their communities. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, Wisconsin has just over 49,000 Hmong residents. Here in Portage County, Hmong residents represent our largest minority population with 1,955 residents in 2010; this is an increase of 28% over the 2000 Census data. The Hispanic/Latino population is the second-largest and the fastest-growing minority population in Portage County with a population of 1,853, representing 2.6% of the Portage County population an increase of 92% over the 2000 Census data. When comparing these data to the number of underserved and protected youth in the Portage County 4-H community clubs, the club program had little or no underserved and protected youth participants. In 2004, the Portage County Alliance for Youth (PCAY) and United Way received a grant that focused on youth engagement opportunities through volunteerism and service learning. 25 teens became members of the Youth Advisory Committee (YAC). This advisory group's mission was to lead the effort in developing and marketing the youth volunteer program to other youth, agencies, organizations, schools, and the community in general. In 2005, we established a YAC Community Hunger Prevention Giving Garden.In 2007, there was a transition at the YAC garden and the program was eliminated by United Way. As one of the community members who worked on establishing the YAC garden, I was determined to keep the garden youth focused and provide programming to underserved and protected youth audiences. So in 2008, I began a partnership with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Portage County to provide a garden, educational programming, and a snack to summer B&GC youth.|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0
339|Community Engaged Leadership: Civic Engagement - By Youth For Y|"This area of emphasis focuses on youth cultivating the habits and skills necessary for political participation in a democratic society and taking individual and collective action to identify and address issues of public concern.4-H Youth Development prioritizes learning by doing to maximize positive youth development outcomes. Successful strategies include:building youth/adult partnership practices into community decision-making, whether within the 4-H organization or in other community settings, from community coalitions to organizational boards and committees. Resources to inform these practices can be found at https://fyi.uwex.edu/youthadultpartnership/ facilitating action planning processes, by which youth can address community issues, either in youth-led spaces with adult coaching or in partnerships with adults working on the same issues. Resources for action planning have been developed for the Tech Changemakers program (https://fyi.uwex.edu/wi4hcitizenship/research-resources/) and the FoodWIse/4-H Youth Development Youth Action for Community Health project)creating opportunities for youth input and decision-making including Teen Courts where youth enact restorative justice, opportunities for youth to serve as advisors on local government boards (Youth in Governance), etc. where they can build relationships with and inform adult decision-makers, youth input into community development through participation in planning process, etc. These opportunities help youth to build understanding of community issues and their civic roles.Youth who participate in these types of opportunities develop habits that make civic participation as adults much more likely. In Wisconsin, we have also seen evidence that youth develop an appreciation for the communities where they live and develop supportive relationships with community adults. Outcomes for communities of youth civic engagement include greater economic and social development that includes young people in all aspects of community life. Key practices developed by the Engaging Young People to Sustain Communities include empowering more diverse community leadership, increasing social capital, and strengthening sense of community and sense of place (see, for example, https://blogs.ces.uwex.edu/engaging-youth/files/2015/02/EYP-White-Paper-February-2015.pdf). These outcomes are particularly important for groups that are marginalized from community leadership due to race, class, or other characteristics.Dane County Situation StatementDane County is one of the most racially and ethnically diverse counties in Wisconsin. The county is also home to some of the fastest growing communities in the state[1]. Dane County is expected to experience the highest numeric growth in the state through 2040[2]. With this population growth comes a growing youth population, and those youth are more diverse than the generations who came before them. Multiple data analyses of educational, employment, and demographic data indicate that Dane County has pervasive and extreme disparities between its black and white citizens[3]. The Race to Equity Baseline Report released in 2013 compiled the data showcasing these disparities. Many of these had a disproportionate impact on Black youth, including the following:Black children in Dane County are over 13 times more likely to be growing up in poverty than white children.Black youth in the Madison Metropolitan School District, the largest school district in the county, have a 50% graduation rate. White children in the same school district have an 85% graduation rate.Suspensions in Dane County schools were 15 times more likely to involve a Black student than a white student. In 2010, the county's black youth arrest rate was 469 per 1,000, compared to 77 per 1,000 for whites, yielding a disparity ratio of 6.1 to 1. Black teens in Dane County in 2010 were six times more likely to be arrested than whites living here, while black youth in the rest of the state were just three times as likely to be arrested as whites.Race to Equity created an extensive list of suggested actions for Dane County agencies and organizations. The following suggested actions, excerpted from their document, could inform Dane County 4-H Youth Development's approach to programming and partnerships:  City and County agencies along with non-profit providers and public school districts should provide increased availability of quality afterschool care and summer/vacation child care and youth programming for school age  Public, private and non-profit sectors should invest in significantly enhancing the availability of core family strengthening resources and amenities in the county's low-income neighborhoods, including access to groceries, pharmacies, banks and safe places for positive supervised youth activities for children of currently underserved working or job-seeking families of color. Many grassroots, neighborhood-based nonprofits and agencies have been working for years to build a network of support for Black youth in Madison. These agencies are deeply connected with their communities, and Dane County 4-H Youth Development can honor these connections by taking the time to learn the history of each organization and build trust with organizational leaders as we form partnerships. The Latinx* population in Dane County is another large and growing portion of the county's overall demographic make-up. Between 2010 and 2014, Dane County's Latinx population was the County's second fastest growing population[4]. Over three-quarters of the Latinx population of Dane County is located in two municipalities: Madison and Fitchburg. Reflecting larger county population patterns, the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) has the highest enrollment of Latinxs with 5,554 Latinxs in K through 12 institutions. These Latinx youth are the second largestracial group in the district after whites (11,724) and represent 20.5% of all MMSD enrolled students. Latinx youth in K through 12 schools are also a growing population. For example, between the 2005-2006 and 2015-2016 school years, Latinx enrollment in MMSD increased 96.3% from 2,830 to 5,554. Of all the major racial groups in Dane County, Latinxs have the lowest levels of educational attainment of adults ages 25 and above. Almost a third (31%) of Latinxs 25 years and above in Dane County do not have a high school diploma. The lowest rates of educational attainment are concentrated toward the near periphery of the County. For example, in Middleton, 41% of Latinxs lack a high school diploma, 38% in Sun Prairie, and 36% in Fitchburg. Recent University of Wisconsin-Extension research on Latinx families in Wisconsin identified specific programming recommendations for families[5]. Through focus groups and interviews, the researchers heard about cultural and language barriers within Latinx families. Parents can struggle to communicate with their own children because of the significant language differences and different cultural experiences between generations. The report recommends English and Spanish language programming for adults and youth; and programming that highlights educational pathways for parents and youth so that Latinx families can better navigate the school system. This is just a snapshot of the disparities existing within the county. As the United Way of Dane County states in their Academic Success Mobilization Plan, ""disparities are not an issue of potential, but rather of students not in a position to receive the same opportunities.""[6] It is the responsibility of UW-Extension 4-H Youth Development staff to analyze and identify where disparities in opportunity exist within our programming, and to work to change institutional and programmatic circumstances so that we can offer more equitable opportunities to the youth of Dane County. It's also our responsibility to apply an asset-based approach to youth development programming. Rather than focusing on disparities and deficits, we need to celebrate youths' strengths and use a culturally relevant approach. We can partner strategically with other youth-serving organizations to build community capacity. *The Dane County Latino Consortium for Action uses the term Latinx to reflect the community's diversity and inclusivity. The term refers to people of Hispanic/Latino origin, regardless of race, or gender identity. We use that term throughout this document to honor that preference.

340|Living Healthy: Emphasis on ATOD and Social-Emotional Health fo|Situation Statement:Multiple layers of wellness choices make up a healthy life - healthy eating habits, physical fitness, positive social interactions and relationships, a healthy and balanced inner life, and the avoidance of risky behaviors. Each of these layers is connected to and impacts the others. For young people, the ability to maintain a healthy life is further influenced by internal beliefs and personal practices as well as their environment - the community, school and home in which they live. Acknowledging the interconnectedness of all layers of health to make up a healthy life, the Living Healthy Team operates in three primary areas:  Nutrition and physical activity - including fitness, nutrition, safety, sexual responsibility, general hygiene, and adequate sleep Social-emotional well-being - including youths' sense of confidence, self-efficacy, emotional regulation, self-reliance and optimism, empathy, connection, contribution, ability to lead a team, teamwork, appreciation of cultural diversity, and civic responsibility  Prevention of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs (ATOD) Furthermore, the nationwide mission mandate of 4-H Youth Development is to expand participation among youth and their families in the dynamic process of healthy living, so they are physically, socially, and emotionally prepared to meet the challenges of the 21st century.Social-Emotional HealthSuicide is the 2nd leading cause of death for young people ages 10-24[1] and the national suicide rate among all ages has been rising for more than a decade. For every suicide death in Wisconsin, there are 11 hospitalizations or emergency department visits for self-inflicted injuries. Wisconsin's teen and young adult population have the highest rates for self-inflicted injury.[2] Statistics like these point to low social and emotional wellness among young people. A further concern is that many of the counties with the highest suicide rates coincide with those having the highest numbers of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs).[3] Many of those counties are rural as well, just one of many indicators of a growing rural health disparity.According to the 2017 Wisconsin Youth Risk Behavior Survey,[4] reports of electronic bullying are increasing - 16.6% in 2011 to 18.4% in 2017. Likewise, 27% of high school students reported feeling sad or hopeless for more than 2 weeks in a row, up from a low of 20.4% in 2009. Nearly 1 in 5 (17%) high school students reported having hurt themselves purposely without wanting to die, self-harm being a coping strategy for many young people who don't have other, healthier strategies available to them.Alcohol, Tobacco and Other DrugsChallenges with high ACE scores and poor mental health have a significant impact on the choices young people make around alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. According to the Wisconsin Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), the smoking rate has decreased from 29% in 2005 to 11% in 2017. Similarly, the rate of marijuana use has also decreased from 7% in 2005 to 5% in 2017. However, a growing trend is the use of electronic vapor products, which was at 11% in 2017. Similarly, youth rates of alcohol use has decreased overall, but the early age of onset (having their first drink of alcohol other than a few sips before age 13) increased from 14.6% in 2013 to 15.5% in 2017, the first increase since 1999. Youth rates of prescription drug misuse - an important precursor to use of street drugs like heroin - have also decreased; yet 1 in 10 youth report having taken prescription pain medications differently than the doctor's recommendation. While the use of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs in Wisconsin is reportedly decreasing, trends within these statistics must be addressed. Vilas County DataVilas County covers 1,018 square miles, nearly 43% of which is public land[5] and therefore non-taxable. Residential areas tend to be widely spread out due to the prevalence of water, as it is home to one of the largest collections of freshwater lakes in the world - more than 1,300 lakes and 73 rivers and streams. The largest town is the county seat of Eagle River with a population of 1,498. The county has approximately 21,683 residents, 17% of whom are 18 years and younger. It is home to a large number of retirees, with approximately 30% of Vilas County residents aged 65 years and older. The Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa reservation sits within the county's borders, and Native Americans make up approximately 11% of the total population[6]. Prevention of alcohol, tobacco and other drug abuse is a top priority for Vilas County's departments of health, social services, and law enforcement. A county profile includes the following information[7]: The annual cost of excessive alcohol abuse in Vilas County was $18,100,000 in 2013. OWI arrests per 100,000 population was 818 in 2014. Wisconsin's state average was 431. Doses of prescription drugs dispensed per county population in 2016 was 33.14 vs. 26.38 statewide. Controlled substance prescriptions written per 1,000 population in 2013 was 736 vs. 572 statewide. Drug law arrests per 100,000 population was 860 in 2014. The state average was 439. Access to drugs and alcohol tends to be higher here than other areas. In terms of alcohol distribution, Vilas had 5.3 alcohol licenses issued per 500 population, vs 1.5 statewide (2014)[8]. And a strong contributing factor to the high number of prescriptions, including controlled substances, is the proportion of retirees. As this group ages and their medical needs increase, more drugs can be found in homes. The prevalence of drugs and alcohol in a rural area such as Vilas County is especially problematic when paired with the lack of mental health practitioners. The vast majority of patients, no matter the age, have to travel 1.5 - 2.0 hours to Marshfield or Wausau for appointments, and no child psychiatrist works in the county. Native AmericansVilas County Sheriff's Department staff members estimate 95% of inmates have addiction issues to drugs and/or alcohol. They also report the majority of inmates have family members with the same issues, and residents of Lac du Flambeau make up a disproportionately high number of cases. Native American families are particularly vulnerable to mental health issues and substance abuse because of high ACE scores due to historical trauma that was suffered on a multi-generational level. The average jail population in 2018 was 113 and on average 64 were Native American.[9] Kit Van Stelle, an evaluation specialist hired by the tribe, searched the records of the Lac du Flambeau police department for data on opioid overdoses and suicides because anecdotal evidence suggested both were underreported. For example, suicide is the leading cause of death among Wisconsin's Native American youth - more than double that of all other races combined - yet there were less than 5 suicides reported in a 5-year period in Vilas County for Native youth and adults combined[10]. Van Stelle probed for data involving threats and attempts as well as deaths, and found that in 2018[11]: Lac du Flambeau police responded to 52 calls for suicide threats. 80% were for natives and 50% for 13 - 25-year olds. There were 17 calls for suicide attempts. Of these, 94% were natives, 75% were female, and 66% were 13 - 25 years old. There were 17 calls for intentional injury. There were 15 calls regarding opioid overdoses, and 12 overlapped with suicide attempts. It is very likely the numbers of opioid overdoses and suicide attempts were underreported. A leading factor is the tribe's distribution of Narcan kits to community members as well as professionals. It is highly likely friends and family members are resuscitating loved ones without reporting the incidents.The Vilas County Board of Supervisors is concerned about the drug epidemic on tribal lands, both in terms of addiction and criminal activity related to the drug trade. Consequently, I have been tasked with focusing almost half of my time on the needs of the Lac du Flambeau tribe. Building working relationships with tribal members takes extra patience because of the following factors: Distrust because of the way Native Americans have been treated by the U.S. government and various educational/social service agencies, both historically and currently. Previous works of non-Natives have failed because of a lack of cultural sensitivity and/or lack of perseverance.  The tribe has its own government, law enforcement, 4K - 8th grade school, and youth center. When combined with the above-mentioned factors, access to tribal youth is more limited than other communities. In addition, the high school students attend Lakeland Union High School, which is in a different county.A recent development that may help connect my work to tribal efforts is a 2-year grant project spearheaded by the Medical College of Wisconsin: Building Capacity for Community-School-University Partnerships for Systemic Transformation - Toward a Culturally Responsive Indigenous Learning Lab. The first year of the project will entail a facilitated process of school-community conversations about school policies/procedures that result in over-representation of Native American students in special education. (Many of these students' issues are referred to special education based on behaviors rather than underlying mental health issues.) New strategies will be developed to address this disproportionality. The following year will be spent on building the capacity of the school-community partnership to sustainably implement this new plan and strategies. I will not discuss this venture at length in my narrative because whatever role I would play is undefined; however, I have included it in my Logic Model to show how it fits into my Plan of Work.As of January 2019, most of my efforts in Lac du Flambeau are based out of three coalitions:  Minobimaadiziiwin Coalition (Mino) Healthier Community Action Team (HCAT) A grassroots-level Community Engagement Team that generates 90-day work plansThese meetings often have the same core people in attendance because of overlapping goals, and this is helping me build relationships. Most of the coalition work will be described in detail in the next section. The Community Engagement Team will not because it doesn't fit under the two major program headings, so I will simply mention two partnership possibilities emerging from this assemblage: One group is starting to work on staging a youth-led conference for all high schoolers in the area, and another is working on establishing a Junior Tribal Council. The latter is especially interested in my background coordinating the youth delegation for Superior Days as I could train students how to lobby government leaders. They are also excited about the option of conducting Community Placemaking exercises. PYD colleague Michelle Gobert and I are getting trained in Placemaking and have discussed having our youth swap communities, both county-wide and between the Lac du Flambeau Chippewa and Forest County Potawatomi reservations. Current Structures: Vilas County Youth Coalition and PartnersShifting the perspective back to the county as a whole: Opportunities for all Vilas County youth are limited. Outside of schools and churches, there are few Third Space sites in the county. There is no Boys & Girls Club, YMCA, or similar programs, and the one existing 4-H club in the county dissolved due to a lack of interest and leaders. In addition, participation in extracurriculars can be difficult for students without driver licenses or vehicles, as many have to commute 45 - 60 minutes to reach their campus. In 2000, my predecessor Nancy Ann Miller founded the Vilas County Youth Coalition (VCYC). Members include school administrators and guidance counselors, AmeriCorps and Recovery Corps personnel, county staff from the health and social services departments, other non-profits, and members of the Lac du Flambeau tribe who work on prevention issues. It has three main guiding principles: Provide a forum for youth-serving agencies to exchange resources and information Foster activities that promote intergenerational partnerships Provide positive opportunities and activities for youth, families and communitiesThe Vilas County Youth Coalition is a 501c3 and the fiscal agent for two other groups: The Northland Pines Community Garden, which is located on the ground of the Northland Pines High School; and the Lac du Flambeau Minobimaadiziiwin Coalition, whose mission is to prevent and reduce substance abuse, especially among youth, by promoting healthy lifestyles with a heavy emphasis on native culture. VCYC's budget includes a $25,000 Partnership for Success grant and $2,000 in grants from the Northwoods Coalition. The Minobimaadiziiwin Coalition and Lac du Flambeau's Healthier Community Action Team also receive grants and we coordinate our efforts with theirs to avoid duplication and stretch our resources as far as possible. For example, VCYC orders lockboxes for all three groups to distribute to community members. Doing so enables us to get volume discounts and reduces the amount of paperwork. We also share a Hidden in Plain Sight Bedroom kit, an upcoming microsite, promotional efforts and ad campaigns for Dose of Reality and kNOwMeth.In addition to these formal partnerships, VCYC also works with: An area-wide Community Engagement Team based in Lac du Flambeau Northwoods Coalition Alliance for Wisconsin Youth A new tri-county version of Children's Coordinated Services Teams for Vilas, Oneida, and Forest counties.The number of area-wide partnerships is reflective of the fact that individual counties do not have enough resources to deal with the ongoing drug epidemic. As noted earlier, many residents must cross county lines for services because they are not offered in their communities. Another reason for the recent proliferation of coalitions is that our counties' populations are not large enough to receive funding from grant providers who are looking to make a large impact. As costs related to the opioid epidemic keep straining county budgets, service providers have gotten more creative finding revenues. One highlight of cross-county coalitions work: I was part of a small task force that successfully recruited all the schools in Forest, Oneida and Vilas counties to administer Wisconsin's Youth Risk Behavior Survey. All students in grades 7 - 12 will take it this spring, providing area health and social service departments important data they can use for needs assessments and grant writing.Leading the Vilas County Youth Coalition and attending various meetings of other coalitions has been very beneficial to my work. My network of contacts is spreading exponentially, including many in decision-making positions. One new development is a shared vision for afterschool programs that will offer middle and high school students opportunities to build their self-reliance as they head towards adulthood.

341|Building Resilient and Financially Capable Families|In Oneida, Vilas and Forest Counties there is a large number of families and individuals accessing services assisting with financial need, including utility assistance and the food pantry. Poverty in the area remains high due to low-wage jobs, part time/seasonal jobs and low educational attainment. Oneida County has a poverty rate of 11.3%, Vilas County 14.4% and Forest County 17.9%. All three counties lack the resources to offer free or affordable financial education programs or coaching to teach those in need how to prioritize spending, maximize income and understand borrowing. In recent years, Northwoods Saves used to offer similar services, but the non-profit folded due to lack of funding. Currently, other than local banks or financial planners that usually charge fees, there is no service such as this available to the public.The Health & Well-being Educator will partner with local agencies to offer financial coaching to individuals that are returning monthly for assistance to help them develop a budget and provide them with the skills needed to support themselves. In addition to coaching services, the Health & Well-being Educator will also provide support for the Get Real financial simulation in Forest County, as well as facilitate pre-simulation financial programming to 11th graders to prepare them for the event. Financial Capability programming will also be done at Head Start. In addition to financial programming, the Health & Well-being Educator will provide support, resources and education for digital parenting programs and court mandated co-parenting education in Vilas and Forest Counties.|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0
342|Incarcerated Resident Entrepreneurship Coaching Program (2019)|"State of African Americans in Wisconsin ""Based on measures of racial inequity, no state is worse for Black residents than Wisconsin,"" according to Frohlich and Sauter (2016). Using data on labor force, poverty, incarceration, infant mortality, and other social indicators, Stebbins & Comen (2018) determined that Milwaukee-Waukesha-West Allis and Racine are the third and fourth worst cities for African Americans in the U.S. Likewise, the Annie E. Casey Foundation's ""Race for Results"" index found Wisconsin to be the worst state for Black children to have ""opportunity for success in adulthood"" (p. 6). In spite of these devastating predictions for the life chances of Black residents, Wisconsin's African American population increased by 18% between the 2000 and 2010 US Census. The University of Wisconsin Applied Population Lab reports that Milwaukee County has 71% of the state's African American population with 253,764 people. Eight additional counties also have significant African American populations: Dane (25,347), Racine (21,767), Kenosha (11,052), Rock (7978), Brown (5491), Waukesha (4914), Winnebago (2975), and Dodge (2381). The median age of the African American population in Wisconsin is about 28 years, more than ten years younger than the entire WI population (Applied Population Lab). Further influencing the lives of Wisconsin's Black residents, Pawasarat and Quinn (2013) report ""one in eight of African American working age men"" are in prison or jail. This rate of mass incarceration is the highest for African American men in the country and nearly double the national average"" (p. 2). They specify that in Milwaukee County, this means ""over half of African American men in their 30s and half of men in their early 40s have been incarcerated in state correctional facilities (Pawasarat & Quinn, 2013, p. 2). Prison records prevent individuals from working in certain industries, and thus African Americans have additional barriers to wealth creation given that 43% of incarcerated men and 21% of incarcerated women in prison in Wisconsin are Black (Wisconsin Department of Corrections, 2018). This is reflected in state data showing that African Americans have the lowest labor force participation rate out of all racial or ethnic groups in the state. In 2017, only 58.5% of all African-Americans in Wisconsin were employed and in the labor force (American Community Survey, US Bureau of the Census). Incarcerated men are estimated to make 40 percent less than their potential annual earnings after release (The Pew Charitable Trusts, 2010), and even when working full- or part-time jobs, 72% of Black parents with children under age six have low incomes, according to the Black Child Development Institute (2014, p. 34). The need for a concentrated effort to expand employment and income generation opportunities for African American residents in Wisconsin is clear.Through the Community Development Institute, county-based Extension educators have been teaching and expanding opportunities for Wisconsin's entrepreneurs for many years, most notably in Bayfield, Fond du Lac, and Waukesha counties. This is a well-documented strategy for rural wealth creation (Deller & Conroy, 2016) since it engages local residents to create and work jobs where they are, rather than relying on newcomers or employers relocating to remote areas. Until now, none of these programs have focused specifically on African-American, incarcerated, or recently released entrepreneurs who could most value it. Nationally, minorities and immigrants start new businesses at higher rates than non-Hispanic white people (Fairlie & Robb, 2010; Obuko & Planting, 2015), despite facing a wide range of challenges such as barriers in accessing information, technical supports in terms of business planning, and financial resources necessary for business startup and expansion (Bonds, 2007; Erdmann, 2016; Freeland & Keister, 2016; Kopkin, 2017). Thus teaching entrepreneurship to soon-to-be-released incarcerated men and women in Wisconsin could have dramatic impacts on their individual life outcomes, their families, their communities, and our state.Why Extension? With its network of county-based educators, state specialists, and local organizational partners, Extension is particularly well-positioned to teach entrepreneurship in prisons. Extension staff are skilled at teaching vulnerable audiences and will easily learn DOC protocol for success in a prison environment. Defy offers training for those starting prison-based programs, includes the use of mentors who are partnered with participants, and engages local organizations in the program, all of which complement Extension's local approach and deep community connections. Because of Extension's statewide presence, mentors will be found in the participants' hometowns who can be a point of inspiration and connection for both them and parole agents in the transition from the institution to their community again."|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
343|Milwaukee County Community Cultural Development Program (2019) |"In-depth analysis and utilization of personal commitments identified from both the stories told by individual residents speaking to how they situation themselves within their community as a collective narrative of civic engagement could break the perpetual cycle of generational poverty, transforming both the statewide Wisconsin and local Milwaukee community environments for necessary policy change, as well as quality of life. From the needs assessment lens, interdependent factors between the state of Wisconsin and the city of Milwaukee's 189 neighborhoods present a daunting demographic profile. Wisconsin has the highest incarceration rate for African American men in the nation, up to 62% in Milwaukee ZIP code 53206 alone. One in eight African-American men in Wisconsin (12.8%) are in state and local prisons; nearly double the national average of 6.7%. Half of African American men in their 30s in Milwaukee County have been in state prison[i]. Across the city of Milwaukee, neighborhood and community leaders are screening the recent 2017 locally produced documentary, Milwaukee 53206. The film illustrates the lived experiences of three 53206 residents, illuminating the story of the individuals and families within communities across the United States who live with the everyday impacts of excessive jail sentencing[ii]. In 2015, Milwaukee suffered with more than triple the violent crime rate in the next most dangerous Wisconsin city and the sixth-highest violent crime rate of U.S. cities. Due in part to the city's high crime rate, in 2016 Milwaukee was selected to receive federal assistance to reduce violence[iii]. As of 2017, Milwaukee is the sixth worst American city to live in[iv], where 26.8% of Milwaukee adult residents and 41% of children under 18 live in poverty. These are the highest poverty rates of any city in the state of Wisconsin, and also are well above the 14.7% national poverty rate. The unemployment rate for black males (ages 25-54) in Milwaukee is 52.7%[v]. Further, Milwaukee is the most segregated city in America, including the greatest segregation of the poor from everyone else than any other metro region.[vi] Wisconsin has been ranked the worst state in the country for racial disparities between black and white children[vii]. Milwaukee Public Schools' 2016 graduation rate was 59.7%, where at that time it has also been stated, ""Over the last five years, the graduation rate at MPS has trended generally downwards and is still nearly 30 points below the statewide average."" [viii]77.6% of children in Milwaukee Public Schools qualify for free or reduced lunches, which their 2016-2017 reports as an indicator of ""economic disadvantage"".[ix] As of 2018, thirteen of Milwaukee County's nineteen municipalities are at or above the 40% of median poverty level indicator for the former UW-Extension Expanding Access program (November 2017, Extension Milwaukee County-specific workshop) as also Asset-Limited, Income-Constrained, Employed (ALICE)[x]. This means that the majority of the residents across backgrounds in these thirteen municipalities of Milwaukee County are functioning just above the median federal poverty rate but are not able to meet the basic living expenses for their municipality and county cost of living, even when factoring in three core factors of economic viability (housing affordability, job opportunities and community resources). Viewed from an asset-building lens, the city of Milwaukee has current opportunities that can turn the tide at the community-wide and neighborhood levels, based on an intentional and developmental infrastructure of community conversations. Throughout calendar year 2017, United Way of Greater Milwaukee and Waukesha County conducted 21 Community Conversations with 215 participants from 55 different zip codes, across Milwaukee and Waukesha Counties. Participants ranged in age from 18-74. 59% of participants were female; 36% of participants were people of color; and 49% of participants reported a household income of $49,999 or less. In their public report of the 2017 Community Conversations, United Way stated they will use this information to inform current partner and community engagement, find new opportunities for collaboration, develop strategies, and mobilize resources.[xi] United Way reported an ""overwhelming"" Community Conversations participant response to the question, ""who do you trust to take action on these issues?"" across all conversations was ""I trust myself."" Additionally, United Way Community Conversations participants mentioned that they trust people they know, faith-based organizations, certain community organizations, and that it takes everyone coming together to truly make progress.Last, the following thematic priorities were revealed from the Community Conversations:1. Safety: address the root causes of crime and drug use, such as poverty and lack of access to family-sustaining jobs, healthcare, safe housing, and positive outlets for kids and teens.2. Diversity: Create opportunities for conversations to help people overcome bias and feel comfortable with one another. Interactions between Neighbors & Neighborhoods: More no- or low-cost, accessible opportunities for families and neighbors to interact, like block parties, clean, safe parks and outdoor events, support groups, etc. Encourage less dependence on, or breaks from, technology and social media Community Connectedness: Again, create no- or low-cost opportunities for neighbors and families to come together in a positive way. Start support groups or networks for community members of all ages to share stories and lean on one another during tough times. Address the root causes of violence and fear, such as systemic racism, trauma, and lack of equitable access to basic needs, like safe housing, family sustaining wages, and quality education and programming for youth.[xii] Wisconsin has built a nationally recognized database about the sustained health impacts of adverse childhood experiences, or, ACEs[xiii]. Statewide as well as in the city of Milwaukee, officials and advocates are just recently putting more resources into understanding community trauma; helping youth and communities recover and heal using a range of methods and practices. ACE surveys determine how many potentially traumatic experiences a child has had, including divorce, death or incarceration of a parent, experiencing or witnessing violence, and living with someone who has a serious mental illness or drug or alcohol problem. Data released January 2018 shows that about 40% of children in multiple Wisconsin counties have had at least four or more ACEs experiences - Milwaukee County included. Sharing their story and reframing their personal narrative through storytelling and narrative construction helps youth and their community support members (and thus the community at large) heal and thrive.[xiv] Moreover, building a community-engaged curriculum based on personal-to-community storytelling and narrative construction is a form of building social support and social cohesion, two social determinants of health that are improved when used alongside related strategies such as reducing social, socio-political and economic inequalities that affect the everyday lives of youth, adults and related community residents[xv]. UW-Extension's working definition of community capacity building integrates the Kretzmann and McKnight (1993) asset-based community development methodology of practice with the Hinds (2008) method of building community capacity. The Hinds (2008) model states that the triangulation of the community environment (analysis from the neighborhood-level out to the broader community boundary), community structures (the relationships and functions between individuals as residents, organizations, networks, and interim structures) and five specific purposed-based actions (planning, learning research, evaluation, and operating/supervising) determines the process of building the community's capacity. I have been working with two specific local Milwaukee-to-national grassroots resident-led/driven learning communities that are centered in aiming to apply John McKnight & Jody Kretzmann's 1993 asset-based community economic development and community capacity building methodology. The two networks are Performing our Future, and, the Population Change Learning Community. Performing our Future partners with several local and national knowledge building partners to support four local community networks, including ""Rural/Urban FLOW"", the Wisconsin community network between Milwaukee County and Sauk County of a specific group of artists and agricultural entrepreneurs that are centered in a core geographic area that they have defined as their central focus, and, they are connected to the city of Milwaukee's formal creative and community placemaking effort One of the lead Milwaukee County artist entrepreneurs involved in the Rural/Urban FLOW Network is Dasha Kelly Hamilton, with whom I am completing an Extension Data Jam February 20,2019 of five of the ten storytelling-centered community forums we held in August 2018 (data to be analyzed by Extension Program Support and Services staff, myself, Dasha and the local youth and adult community artists we engaged to conduct community surveys in seven neighborhoods pre-forum, reviewing the community research-based spoken word pieces that were utilized in each of the five forums as discussion prompts after personal stories were told by participants, and, some of the 250 forum participants we engaged in a total of ten forums between fall 2017 and summer 2018 The Population Change Learning Community (PCLC) is led by UCLA Center for Healthier Children, Families and Communities faculty Patricia Bowie and also partners with several local and national knowledge building partners to support nine local community support organizations in nine local communities, including the WI, which is adjacent to several of the neighborhoods involved in the ""Rural/Urban FLOW"" network above. I began working with PCLC in 2014. Both of these networks are aiming to include social impact analysis/social & community network analysis and ""culturally responsive community development/evaluation"" as desired tools to support each of their learning community practice goals of culturally inclusive and equitable ""development"".

346|Social Emotional Well-being of Children and Families: Coalition|Families perform a number of functions that provide private benefits to their members and public benefits to society. For example, in the midst of a global economic transformation, every nation's competitiveness will depend more than ever on its human capital, specifically the education and social skills of its labor force (Reynolds & Temple, 2005). Human capital in today's knowledge-based economies requires cognitive and noncognitive skills, which are shaped, to a large extent, by socialization that occurs early in family life (Heckman, 2006). Families also contribute to the rearing of caring, committed member of society. When children have relationships with their parents that are sensitively responsive and reliably available, they develop many qualities that societies value in their citizenry. Things like, involvement, leadership self-confidence, and social competence in problem-solving situations (Englund, Levy, Hyson, & Sroufe, 2000).In 2017, community partners from Dodge and Jefferson Counties came together with shared concern for the children and families in our communities. Collective work began with a multi-agency Design Team comprised of 15 organizational representatives from these two counties. Out of that work came Every Child Thrives (ECT). ECT is a collective impact effort uniting community partners centered on the vision of ensuring all children thrive in health, learning and life. The two counties served by ECT share similar demographics and culture and have a long history of working together to advance health and education. In late 2015, our two county region was gifted with additional resources when the Greater Watertown Community Health Foundation (GWCHF) was created with an endowment to be utilized to measurably improve community health status. Through its needs assessment process in partnership with the Dodge Jefferson Healthy Community Partnership and through an extensive listening campaign, GWCHF learned of the many challenges and barriers that limit the potential of families and young children. The health providers, educators and human service providers serving the community noted that poverty, substance abuse, adverse childhood experiences and toxic stress were impacting the region at an alarmingly increased rate. Through these discussions, community partners not only identified a need to amplify efforts to support young children and families, they also identified a strong willingness to contribute to the efforts. Partners were energized by one another and by the possibilities the new resources and momentum presented. With this realization, ECT was born. Located midway between Wisconsin's two metropolitan centers of Madison and Milwaukee, Dodge and Jefferson Counties are primarily rural. The majority of residents live in small towns with limited resources including public transportation, affordable housing, access to mental health and dental care services for children. Manufacturing, agriculture and service are the primary industries.This work is initially focused on families and children, ages pre-natal through third grade, in the Dodgeland School District and the Watertown Unified School District. As success is demonstrated, the scope will expand to include all families and children in Jefferson and Dodge Counties.|1|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
347|Social Emotional Well-being of Children and Families: Outreach |"Family Well-beingFamilies perform a variety of key functions that contribute to both the mental and physical health of individuals as well as the public health and functioning of society. Throughout all developmental stages, from the prenatal period to the last years of life, strong healthy relationships help families effectively and efficiently raise healthy children, care for vulnerable members, and sustain productive workers and contributing community members. Children who are born into and raised in an environment of positive relationships have a strong foundation that can help them develop into healthy adults and productive citizens. This environment of relationships involves not only parents and children but also extended family and social networks, schools and childcare providers, and others who engage with the family. Stable, nurturing relationships have a powerful protective impact on children. They help prevent exposure to multiple risks and stressors, including family violence and neglect, parental incarceration, and mental illness. Exposure to these stressors is associated with numerous poor outcomes, some of which are commonly seen across multiple generations within families and are very costly to society. In addition to contributing to prevention, safe, stable, nurturing relationships with parents and other caregivers serve as a buffer to help mitigate the damaging impacts of toxic stress. Healthy relationships help children thrive. Quality ChildcareSince many families depend on childcare providers during the first years of a child's life, providers can play a key role in strengthening families and building stronger communities. Childcare programs provide important preventive services, often taking on the role of family resource centers in communities that lack such services. Childcare providers are viewed as the ""experts"" in child development. They connect parents to community resources, model developmentally appropriate parenting practices and provide education related to stages of child development. Parents and providers working together in partnership create healthy environments and long-term benefits for children. Social, emotional and intellectual learning are inextricably linked. Supportive relationships and healthy interactions shape brain circuits and lay a foundation for academic and developmental successes. Most young children spend some time in non-parental care. Infants and toddlers with employed mothers spend an average of 25 hours per week in childcare, and 39% are in childcare for 35 hours or more each week. In Dodge County, there are more than 5,000 children, under the age of six, in regulated childcare settings (including certified or licensed home-based centers, group childcare centers, Head Start and preschool programs, and half-day 4K programs). It is estimated that more than 70% of Wisconsin's young children are in some type of child care or early education programs outside of their homes. The quality of childcare care is a key determinant of how well prepared children are for school. Technology and the Modern FamilyRecent trends in technology are changing the way that families interact, learn and build relationships. Infants, toddlers, and preschoolers are now growing up in environments saturated with a variety of traditional and new technologies, which they are adopting at increasing rates. Ninety-eight percent of homes with children under eight have mobile devices according to a study from Common Sense Media. Although there has been much hope for the educational potential of interactive media for young children, accompanied by fears about their overuse during this crucial period of rapid brain development, research in this area remains limited. The American Academy of Pediatrics has recently addressed the influence of media on the health and development of children from zero to 5 years of age, a time of critical brain development, building secure relationships, and establishing health behaviors. Through this research, the Digital Parenting Workgroup has been able to apply findings to current and future work around digital media. Research shows that digital media can be a useful means for providing education to parents and studies have found that online parenting education can be as effective as face-to-face settings in influencing positive parenting change. Today's average American spends almost nine hours per day using technology and owns four digital devices. Digital devices have proven to be a great equalizer, providing young adults, minorities, those with no college experience, and those with lower household income levels a connection to the Internet. Access to digital devices and the Internet is no longer limited to middle class families; the clear majority of parents, including those from low-income and vulnerable populations, are now connected. Available web-based knowledge and programs can both stand-alone and supplement face-to-face programs. Increasingly, the web has become the initial point of contact where parents seek out and access information. It also functions as the ""front door"" through which parents learn about and connect to local and county resources, including face-to-face education and assistance. Having a prominent online presence is critical to successfully reaching and educating parents in the 21st century."|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0
348|Work Plan for FoodWIse Interim State Coordinator, FFY19 quarter|"Situation statement (Why): The FoodWIse program is funded by two major grants (SNAP-Ed and EFNEP) which provide for a program that serves over 75,000 low income individuals and families each year. As Interim State Coordinator, my role in the next 6 months is to continue to implement the 3-year program plan and the daily management of partnerships, budgets and staff. During this period there will be an annual program planning/budget planning process that takes place at the county project level and state level. The total budget allocation for FoodWIse is approximately $8 million and an effort to ""right size"" project budgets in response to demographics and need has been ongoing for several years. This year, county projects will begin the process with a 3-year plan and action plan in place, and will make adjustments to budgets only as needed. A simplified process for gathering and reviewing this information will save time and effort for coordinators as well as state staff.There are several new state staff and new positions with statewide responsibility that require ongoing guidance as they develop into their roles. There may also be a permanent State Coordinator hired within the next 6 months. A major effort of this position will be to help these teams clarify roles in developing and implementing programming that meets local needs within the state plan."|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0
349|Building community capacity through research, strategic plannin|Situational Analysis:To effectively address current and emerging community needs in Chippewa County, it is important to build community capacity using unbiased research-based knowledge and practices. This includes utilization of local data to understand phenomena and make informed decisions regarding priorities and allocation of resources. Faced with growing needs and limited resources, many government departments and nonprofit organizations have reached out to the Extension for assistance in the areas of research, strategic planning, and evaluation. While a lot have been achieved in this area, strategic planning and evaluation are need-based and ongoing programs area that will continue to be critical for prioritization and efficiency.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
350|Community Engaged Leadership: Civic Engagement - Youth Governan|"This area of emphasis focuses on youth cultivating the habits and skills necessary for political participation in a democratic society and taking individual and collective action to identify and address issues of public concern.4-H Youth Development prioritizes learning by doing to maximize positive youth development outcomes. Successful strategies include:building youth/adult partnership practices into community decision-making, whether within the 4-H organization or in other community settings, from community coalitions to organizational boards and committees. Resources to inform these practices can be found at https://fyi.uwex.edu/youthadultpartnership/ facilitating action planning processes, by which youth can address community issues, either in youth-led spaces with adult coaching or in partnerships with adults working on the same issues. Resources for action planning have been developed for the Tech Changemakers program (https://fyi.uwex.edu/wi4hcitizenship/research-resources/) and the FoodWIse/4-H Youth Development Youth Action for Community Health project)creating opportunities for youth input and decision-making including Teen Courts where youth enact restorative justice, opportunities for youth to serve as advisors on local government boards (Youth in Governance), etc. where they can build relationships with and inform adult decision-makers, youth input into community development through participation in planning process, etc. These opportunities help youth to build understanding of community issues and their civic roles.Youth who participate in these types of opportunities develop habits that make civic participation as adults much more likely. In Wisconsin, we have also seen evidence that youth develop an appreciation for the communities where they live and develop supportive relationships with community adults. Outcomes for communities of youth civic engagement include greater economic and social development that includes young people in all aspects of community life. Key practices developed by the Engaging Young People to Sustain Communities include empowering more diverse community leadership, increasing social capital, and strengthening sense of community and sense of place (see, for example, https://blogs.ces.uwex.edu/engaging-youth/files/2015/02/EYP-White-Paper-February-2015.pdf). These outcomes are particularly important for groups that are marginalized from community leadership due to race, class, or other characteristics.Dane County Situation StatementDane County is one of the most racially and ethnically diverse counties in Wisconsin. The county is also home to some of the fastest growing communities in the state[1]. Dane County is expected to experience the highest numeric growth in the state through 2040[2]. With this population growth comes a growing youth population, and those youth are more diverse than the generations who came before them. Multiple data analyses of educational, employment, and demographic data indicate that Dane County has pervasive and extreme disparities between its black and white citizens[3]. The Race to Equity Baseline Report released in 2013 compiled the data showcasing these disparities. Many of these had a disproportionate impact on Black youth, including the following:Black children in Dane County are over 13 times more likely to be growing up in poverty than white children.Black youth in the Madison Metropolitan School District, the largest school district in the county, have a 50% graduation rate. White children in the same school district have an 85% graduation rate.Suspensions in Dane County schools were 15 times more likely to involve a Black student than a white student. In 2010, the county's black youth arrest rate was 469 per 1,000, compared to 77 per 1,000 for whites, yielding a disparity ratio of 6.1 to 1. Black teens in Dane County in 2010 were six times more likely to be arrested than whites living here, while black youth in the rest of the state were just three times as likely to be arrested as whites.Race to Equity created an extensive list of suggested actions for Dane County agencies and organizations. The following suggested actions, excerpted from their document, could inform Dane County 4-H Youth Development's approach to programming and partnerships:  City and County agencies along with non-profit providers and public school districts should provide increased availability of quality afterschool care and summer/vacation child care and youth programming for school age  Public, private and non-profit sectors should invest in significantly enhancing the availability of core family strengthening resources and amenities in the county's low-income neighborhoods, including access to groceries, pharmacies, banks and safe places for positive supervised youth activities for children of currently underserved working or job-seeking families of color. Many grassroots, neighborhood-based nonprofits and agencies have been working for years to build a network of support for Black youth in Madison. These agencies are deeply connected with their communities, and Dane County 4-H Youth Development can honor these connections by taking the time to learn the history of each organization and build trust with organizational leaders as we form partnerships. The Latinx* population in Dane County is another large and growing portion of the county's overall demographic make-up. Between 2010 and 2014, Dane County's Latinx population was the County's second fastest growing population[4]. Over three-quarters of the Latinx population of Dane County is located in two municipalities: Madison and Fitchburg. Reflecting larger county population patterns, the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) has the highest enrollment of Latinxs with 5,554 Latinxs in K through 12 institutions. These Latinx youth are the second largestracial group in the district after whites (11,724) and represent 20.5% of all MMSD enrolled students. Latinx youth in K through 12 schools are also a growing population. For example, between the 2005-2006 and 2015-2016 school years, Latinx enrollment in MMSD increased 96.3% from 2,830 to 5,554. Of all the major racial groups in Dane County, Latinxs have the lowest levels of educational attainment of adults ages 25 and above. Almost a third (31%) of Latinxs 25 years and above in Dane County do not have a high school diploma. The lowest rates of educational attainment are concentrated toward the near periphery of the County. For example, in Middleton, 41% of Latinxs lack a high school diploma, 38% in Sun Prairie, and 36% in Fitchburg. Recent University of Wisconsin-Extension research on Latinx families in Wisconsin identified specific programming recommendations for families[5]. Through focus groups and interviews, the researchers heard about cultural and language barriers within Latinx families. Parents can struggle to communicate with their own children because of the significant language differences and different cultural experiences between generations. The report recommends English and Spanish language programming for adults and youth; and programming that highlights educational pathways for parents and youth so that Latinx families can better navigate the school system. This is just a snapshot of the disparities existing within the county. As the United Way of Dane County states in their Academic Success Mobilization Plan, ""disparities are not an issue of potential, but rather of students not in a position to receive the same opportunities.""[6] It is the responsibility of UW-Extension 4-H Youth Development staff to analyze and identify where disparities in opportunity exist within our programming, and to work to change institutional and programmatic circumstances so that we can offer more equitable opportunities to the youth of Dane County. It's also our responsibility to apply an asset-based approach to youth development programming. Rather than focusing on disparities and deficits, we need to celebrate youths' strengths and use a culturally relevant approach. We can partner strategically with other youth-serving organizations to build community capacity. *The Dane County Latino Consortium for Action uses the term Latinx to reflect the community's diversity and inclusivity. The term refers to people of Hispanic/Latino origin, regardless of race, or gender identity. We use that term throughout this document to honor that preference.

353|Manure Management/Nutrient Management|The dairy industry in Wisconsin produces the equivalent of 12 billion gallons of liquid manure annually. (That's enough to cover a football field more than 5 miles high). Properly managed and applied, it is a valuable nutrient source and builds soil health. Improperly managed, and it has a high potential to contribute to ground and surface water contamination (nutrient and pathogen). State agencies (DNR, DATCP) and federal partners (USDA NRCS, EPA) recognize the issue and have implemented a variety of voluntary and mandatory programs/rules to reduce the risk. While implementation has reduced the problem, it has not successfully eliminated it. Extension's role is toa. Provide education to those who apply and manage manureb. Explore research and innovative technologies that producers can use to reduce the riskPrevious work with the for-hire manure applicators, impacted local citizen groups (such as Midwest Environmental Advocates, Kewaunee Cares), USDA-ARS DFRC, UWEX Groundwater experts and my own peer-reviewed journal article) documents the impact of manure-related runoff on the drinking water supplies of rural residents who do not have access to municipal water systems, but also shows that incremental changes in management do have an impactBoth educational outreach and technological solutions will need to be employed to reduce livestock agriculture's impact on ground and surface water quality. Annual surveys of the for-hire manure applicators (personally conducted) document changes in equipment used and technology adoption in the industry.A separate but unique situation is the recent increase in manure spill impacts. Discussions with DNR staff indicate that many larger manure spill impacts could have been prevented if farmers had access to private sector consultants who could advise them on the proper steps to take during a spill or runoff event.|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
354|Fostering Health and Wellness in Waushara County in 2019|Unhealthy individual behaviors in Wisconsin and Waushara CountyWaushara County is a rural, low-income county in central Wisconsin that is located 80 miles south of Madison, with 24,496 residents. The population is predominantly White and non-Hispanic; the largest minority group is Hispanic, at 6.1% of the population or approximately 1484 people and Black or African Americans at 2.1% of the population or 511 people. 19% of the population is under the age of 18. The Waushara County Average Annual Wage is $31,608 compared to Wisconsin's $46,031. Waushara County is ranked 48 in the County Health Rankings for overall health outcomes. In Waushara County 34% of adults are obese; 61% of residents have access to exercise compared to the state at 86% having access. 9% of residents are uninsured. According to the June 2018 Report of Annual Death from the Department of Health Services, in Wisconsin cancer is the leading cause of death for ages 25-64. In that age range in 2016, 3093 people died from cancer, 846 from drug overdose, and 1895 from heart disease. In Waushara County, 96 died from heart disease and 72 from cancer, and there's insufficient data for drug overdose mortality.Approximately two-thirds of all deaths in Wisconsin are attributed to chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes. In Waushara County, the top two killers are heart disease and cancer according to the 2015 DHS Annual Death Report, with 96 deaths from heart disease, and 72 reported from cancer. The leading age group for cancer deaths in Wisconsin is ages 45-64. According to the Wisconsin Behaviors Risk Factor Surveillance System over half of Wisconsin residents are living with at least one chronic disease. These chronic diseases can be disabling, can cause distress and require extensive medical treatment and care for individuals and families living with these conditions.Obesity and overweight contribute to these chronic diseases. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nearly 3 out of 10 Wisconsin residents are obese and another one-third are overweight. One of every 4 Wisconsin high school students is overweight or obese and 29 percent of 2-3 year old children participating in the WIC program are overweight or obese. The incidence of obesity is greater for Wisconsinites who are black, Hispanic, Native American or who have low incomes. A small set of modifiable risk factors are responsible for most of the leading chronic diseases: unhealthy diet; insufficient physical activity; tobacco use/smoke exposure; and alcohol abuse. Approximately 43% of Wisconsin adults fail to meet physical activity recommendations and nearly 1 of 5 engages in no leisure-time physical activity. About 75% of Wisconsin adults do not consume fruits or vegetables 5 or more times per day. Most food-borne illness is due to improper storage, handling, and preparation of food in the home. Therefore, in addition to improved diet and physical activity behaviors, Wisconsinites need to use safe food handling practices.Girls starting puberty (ages 9-12) are at an increased risk of low self-esteem and poor body image which is related to depression and lower academic grades. Factors contributing to low self-esteem include obesity and media influence. Girls with low self-esteem at the age of 12 are 2.5X more likely to engage in heavy alcohol use at the age of 15. Girls who have a low opinion of themselves are 4X more likely to engage in activities with boys that they will regret later. The 2018 Waushara County Youth Risk Behavior Assessment was completed by 302 sophomore and senior high school students. 75 students identified being bullied in the past year. 48 seriously considered attempting suicide in the 12 months before the survey. In the 30 days before the survey 33 students had five or more alcoholic drinks in a couple hours; the same number had used marijuana, and 18 students had used prescription medications that were not prescribed to them, or different than their doctor had prescribed[11] Wisconsin Department of Health Services.

355|Homegrown: Entrepreneurship in Your Community-An Entrepreneuria|Wisconsin is consistently listed as one of the least, if not the least entrepreneurial (Kauffman, Conroy and Deller 2016) and dynamic (Economic Innovation Group) states in the country. Further, the state has a strong manufacturing legacy and because of the pressures of globalization and technological advancement, this sector is losing employment power (Conroy 2018). These factors are directly related to economic performance of the state, including the slow jobs recovery and tepid wage growth. These factors are important to the quality of life of Wisconsin residents, particularly in rural areas which have been struggling more than urban areas.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
356|Nonpoint Source Pollution Outreach and Education |Society has made tremendous progress reducing surface and groundwater pollution since passage of the Clean Water Act. In recent decades nonpoint source pollution from agricultural, urban, forested and other land uses remains the single largest cause of ongoing water quality problems. These problems manifest most commonly in Wisconsin as surface water algal blooms and sedimentation and in groundwater as elevated nitrates and other contaminants. These impacts have significant effects on public health, local economies and natural communities.Reducing the impacts on nonpoint source pollution through regulation is, by definition, problematic given the dispersed nature of the pollutants. Therefore, outreach and education plays a prominent role in alternate approaches. The Regional Natural Resources Program employs a variety of responses to this challenge, primarily through a contractual relationship with the Wisconsin DNR Nonpoint Source Program.|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
357|Increasing groundwater literacy|"A clean and dependable supply of water is critical to ensure a high quality of life and maintain a strong economy. Groundwater is of particular importance to Wisconsin with nearly 95% of communities and all rural residents rely wells that access it for their water supply. Groundwater also supplies the majority of water to Wisconsin's streams and rivers and is instrumental to lake levels and wetlands. Groundwater is often referred to as Wisconsin's ""buried treasure"". As valuable as this resource is to Wisconsin, it is often not well understood by the general public or elected officials who may be asked to make decisions about managing this resource. Thanks to scientists we now have a much better understanding of this resource than we once used to, but confusion and simple questions such as what groundwater is, how it moves, or what causes groundwater contamination still exist. Translating that scientific knowledge to the broader community however is an ongoing need. One of the best tools to educate people about groundwater is the sand-tank groundwater model. The sand-tank model is a highly visual teaching tool that represents a cross section of the earth and allows people to see how groundwater moves through the soil and rock layers below us. By adding colored dye to simulate pollutants, or pumping wells to simulate groundwater withdrawals; viewers are better able to visualize and understand complex groundwater principles. A previous survey of educators indicated that for participants in trainings where models have been used, over 90% of respondents said that the sand-tank model increased their confidence in teaching about groundwater. In addition, 88% indicated that incorporating the sand-tank groundwater model into their curriculum was more effective than traditional teaching methods for helping students understand groundwater; and that it resulted in students that were more actively engaged in groundwater lessons. This Extension research and programming is designed to enhance literacy of groundwater and ultimately help the next generation of Wisconsinites and future leaders make informed decisions related to waters of the state."|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
358|Developing more profitable and resilient community food systems|"Introduction and backgroundCommunities in Chippewa County faces arrays of social and economic challenges. According to Chippewa Community Health Improvement Partnership 2018 needs assessment, mental health, substance abuse and alcohol abuse, and obesity emerged are among major concerns. Although the U.S census Bureau indicates poverty rate in Chippewa County to be 11%, there is a wide perception among community leaders and organizations that poverty is more widespread than reported on national data. According to the United Ways ALICE 2018 report, the overall percentage of households struggling to meet basic cost of living in Chippewa County was 26%, which is slightly higher than the state overage of 25.8 %. Cities with the highest ALICE poverty households include Stanley 55%, Chippewa Falls 51%, Cornel 51%, Edson 48%, Cadott Village 48%, and 42% in Bloomer. ALICE is an acronym for Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed - households that earn more than the Federal Poverty Level, but less than the basic cost of living for the county.Chippewa County is situated in the Chippewa River Valley of west central Wisconsin. The county is bordered by Rusk and Barron counties to the north, Taylor and Clark counties to the east, Eau Claire County to the south, and Dunn County to the west. In 2017, the county population was 63,813, with 46% being rural. The county comprises of 11 villages and cities: Bloomer, Boyd, Cadott, Chippewa Falls, Cornell, Holcombe, Jim Falls, Lake Hallie, New Auburn, and Stanley. Chippewa county seat is located in the city of Chippewa Falls that has the population of 13,965. Major economic sources in the county are agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, manufacturing, and healthcare and social services. Frac sand mining has been an important employment source but has slowed down probably due to decline in energy costs. My two major educational programing below were informed by results of community needs assessments I conducted in 2016 and 2017-2018, available existing data, county priorities, and three-year experience working in the community.Situational Analysis:Chippewa County continues to prioritize agriculture for community economic development. This project builds on three-year experience working with small family farms and other stakeholders to organize more profitable local food system that increases income for farmers, enhances local economy, and addresses food insecurity across. Regardless of great potential, infrastructure for local food is lacking and there is limited market for local food in the area. For example, there are no opportunities for farmers to connect and share knowledge and experiences. Similarly, there is no mechanisms to link farmers and potential customers seeking local food. Chippewa Community Health Improvement Partnership needs assessment has consistently indicates the need for improving food security among poor households and communities, particularly in rural setting lacking grocery stores. According to the assessment, about one quarter of Chippewa County residents lives in areas designated as food deserts - defined by the USDA as ""urban neighborhoods and rural towns without ready access to fresh, healthy, and affordable food""[i]. Establishing strong profitable local food systems requires leadership and active participation of the community involved. In addition to providing fresh healthy food and education about food and nutrition, community gardens serve as platforms for social interaction, bringing people together to share experiences and information. Social interaction is particularly important in the increasingly socially isolated communities as it provides safe spaces for residents to inclusive build networks, with the potential for overall neighborhood improvement. A recent community needs assessment in the county indicate great interests in community garden. Research participants specifically cited the need for community gardens as an ideal space for socialization and peer-to-peer interaction to exchange resources and build skills. This program will address the issue of infrastructure for local foods in Chippewa County through research, education, and leadership development.

359|2019 field research with western WI farmers and partners to enh|Situation StatementDiscovery Farms has conducted a nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) project with 50+ WI farmers, as guided by Dr. Matt Ruark and our staff (2015-2017). Through this time, we refined field methodology and results messaging while working with farmers and their corn production practices. This process offered participants 1:1 season-long, and between production year, insights into how corn nitrogen (N) management can be altered to achieve economically optimum yields while reducing N losses to the environment.Current Land and Water Resource Management Plans for Sauk, Pepin and Dunn Counties, WI, each define groundwater quality as a resource priority. USDA Soil Surveys and County Plans also show that they each have significant agricultural production areas of courser textured soil over somewhat shallow sedimentary bedrock aquifers, and similar production areas over unconfined sand and gravel aquifers. Each county defines approximately 15% of private drinking water wells to exceed the safe drinking standard of 10 mg/l nitrate-nitrogen.In 2018, Discovery Farms began a 3-year partnering process with local Extension and natural resource agencies to teach them NUE field trial methodology as we jointly delivered 1:1 NUE training to small groups of farmers in Sauk, Pepin, and Dunn Counties. Year number two of this process will be pursued in 2019. This process allows both the partners and farmers they work with to enhance local, practical, and feasible corn N management under the guidance of Discovery Farms. After 3 years, a framework will exist for farmers and their local education / conservation agencies to pursue ongoing field trials that teach best corn N management for production and water quality, allowing Discovery Farms to begin the process with other partners.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
360|Environmental Education 2019 Statewide - DOTS and Data Literacy|"Embracing Technology Rooted in Heritage of Upham WoodsWhen the University of Wisconsin received the donation of land that would become Upham Woods, Wakelin McNeel served as the Center's first superintendent. McNeel was also known as ""Ranger Mac"", a persona he created for a Wisconsin Public Radio show that he hosted. As part of his show, he invited youth and adults from all across Wisconsin to reflect on, observe, engage, and conserve the state's wonderful natural resources. On the program, he often noted that ""If you didn't take a walk yesterday, you missed out on many things that may not come again"" (Matkin-Rawn 2004). Today, we share these same sentiments with our students, encouraging them to observe their surroundings and ask questions that enable them to better understand the world they inhabit. While Ranger Mac worked at Upham Woods in the 1930s and 1940s, many parallels exist between his service to the state and the direction Upham is headed today. Ranger Mac used the technology of the era radio to connect a statewide audience to the environment. By using a resource that was both pervasive and accessible, he drew youth and adults to issues in our natural world and also enabled them to explore Upham Woods. Today, we accomplish these same objectives through the Digital Observation Technology Skills (DOTS) program and web-based resources. Ranger Mac's approach focused on observation and wonder in the outdoors. Today, we use terms such as informal science learning (ISL), inquiry-based instruction, project-based learning and place-based education to describe this same approach. Although there have been many changes in the last 76 years at Upham Woods, it continues to serve a crucial statewide presence in environmental education outreach by leveraging an effective blend of technology and youth development, within a context of vibrant natural resources and scenic beauty.Confidence in this Well-founded ApproachThe National Research Council's research shows that ISL is guided by student inquiry about the natural world, data collection related to their inquiry, and opportunities to present their findings to peers and community members (National Research Council, 2009). Further, the National Research Council states that informal learning environments are, in principle, accessible to all learners, and evidence suggests they have particular potential for supporting learners from non-dominant groups (National Research Council, 2009). In addition to providing experiential learning opportunities grounded in environmental concepts, ISL centers like Upham Woods expand the network of educators and facilitators engaged in environmental education and provide students with ""direct access to compelling phenomena in the natural world"" (National Science Foundation, 2011).While ISL centers, such as camps and nature centers, have historically had programming legacies rooted in the natural sciences, their educational practices can be in tension with the emphasis on the adoption of modern technology that often guides contemporary STEM education (Cuthbertson, Socha, & Potter, 2004). Yet using technology in outdoor education settings holds great promise in deepening scientific connections to local places through data collection. As an example, data collection within a context of location, community, and inquiry provides a place-based approach to education that contributes to active and engaged citizens (Hougham & Kerlin, 2016; Sobel, 2004). In modern science classrooms and careers, most scientific tools are digital. Consequently, adopting digital tools requires ISL centers to strike a careful balance between retaining the connection to place that outdoor, experiential learning promotes and serving youth and educators with modern STEM curricula. Connecting this further, place-based education like that promoted at Upham Woods has been shown to connect learners' STEM engagement to their experiences in informal settings, develop their acute observation skills, and increase their capacity to care about the environment around them (Land & Zimmerman, 2015; Greenwood & Hougham, 2015)."|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
361|Promoting Resilient Families and Communities (2019)|Kewaunee County is rural with a population of 20,545 and 8,125 households. Ninety-six percent of the residents are White with a growing Hispanic population of 4.5%. In 2016, 19% of residents were 65 or older and 18% are caregivers of elderly or disabled family member or friend. The median household income is $53,023 which is slightly higher than the state average but 39% of households are struggling to afford basic needs (ALICE report, 2014). Employment opportunities are limited in the county and 35% of workers have longer commutes (30 minutes or more) to work compared to 17% of workers in neighboring counties (Kewaunee County Quality of Life Report, 2012). Research has linked long work commutes to stress and poor health. Occupational stress related to agriculture work is also a concern in Kewaunee County. The stress of workers is not isolated, it impacts their families and communities. Adults report 3.4 mentally unhealthy days per month (County Health Rankings, 2018) and 24% of youth reported feeling sad or hopeless almost daily (Kewaunee County YRBS 2018). In 2015, Kewaunee County had 108 marriages and in 2016 there were 52 divorces; nearly a 50% divorce rate. Through survey feedback and during community coalition work, families have expressed to me the challenges they experience as a result of divorce, separation, incarceration, foster care placement, caregiving responsibilities, or work-related stress. Educational programs and collaborative community supports can promote resiliency to strengthen families and the community as they address challenges affecting their physical, mental and emotional wellbeing across the lifespan. Research is clear that strong family and other interpersonal relationships significantly contribute to the health and wellbeing of individuals across the lifespan. Family strengthening programs and policies help build strong relationships within supportive communities, improving outcomes for children, families and society.Families perform a variety of key functions that contribute to both the mental and physical health of individuals as well as the public health and functioning of society. Throughout all developmental stages, from the prenatal period to the last years of life, strong healthy relationships help families effectively and efficiently raise healthy children, care for vulnerable members, and sustain productive workers and contributing community members.Children who are born into and raised in an environment of positive relationships have a strong foundation that can help them develop into healthy adults and productive citizens. This environment of relationships involves not only parents and children but also extended family and social networks, schools and childcare providers, and others who engage with the family. Stable, nurturing relationships have a powerful protective impact on children. They help prevent exposure to multiple risks and stressors, including family violence and neglect, parental incarceration, and mental illness. Exposure to these stressors is associated with numerous poor outcomes, some of which are commonly seen across multiple generations within families and are very costly to society. In addition to contributing to prevention, safe, stable, nurturing relationships with parents and other caregivers serve as a buffer to help mitigate the damaging impacts of toxic stress. Healthy relationships help children thrive.Adult health and well-being also depend in great part on the quality and success of relationships. Adults in stable relationships have better health outcomes, greater financially stability, a greater sense of well-being and improved capacity to provide care for vulnerable family members, including children and older adults. It has long been understood that a strong parent/child relationship is a key factor in preventing negative outcomes for children. More recent research suggests that strong relationships between parents and other adults, including romantic partners, friends and extended family, can help prevent child maltreatment and improve the capacity of adults to parent effectively. Healthy relationships help adults nurture.For seniors, social connections and strong family relationships are critical to continued wellbeing and engagement. As the nation and Wisconsin experience a demographic shift toward a greater proportion of older adults, it is critical to invest in programs that keep seniors connected and contributing in their roles as active citizens, caregivers for children and older adults, and as part of the social support system of partners, friends and others. Healthy relationships support seniors' wellbeing.In this plan, I will work to strengthen the family and enhance relationships in order to promote lifelong mental, physical and emotional health. Recognizing that families do not exist in isolation and that they are influenced by many settings, institutions, norms, policies, and transitions, I will offer programming which acts on research to:? support caregiver skills across developmental stages,? target periods of significant stress for families and caregivers,? reach learners through traditional and digital methods, and? connect individuals and communities through systems level work.|1|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0

Their employers invest in their tuition and the time required for their participation. The return on that investment is a more engaged and aware employee who is better equipped to lead. The Sauk County Board of Supervisors are also significantly invested in the program. If SCIL graduates can amplify the positive effects of their investment in the county their financial support is justified.The Sauk County Institute of Leadership aims to educate and inspire participants to grow their leadership skills, to apply those skills to their lives and to enhance their communities. The need for leaders throughout the county never diminishes.

364|Addressing Accessibility, Availability and Acceptability in Rur|The topic of improving mental health is at the forefront of conversations in both Green and Lafayette Counties. In 2016 and 2019 Green County's Community Health Needs Assessment ranked mental health in the top four issues to be addressed. Lafayette County last performed a Community Health Needs Assessment in 2015 and ranked mental health seventh behind drug and alcohol issues, aging problems, healthy lifestyle choices/behaviors and access to care. Green and Lafayette Counties have a ratio of community members to mental health providers of 1120:1 and 560:1 respectively. The statewide suicide death rate for 2009-2013 was 13.5 per 100,000 individuals. In Green County the suicide death rate was 15.8 and Lafayette's was 17.9. Beyond the rankings around mental health lay the factors of everyday life. Both communities' economies rely heavily on the agricultural sector. Much stress exists due to the current agriculture climate. The Hispanic community expresses anxiety both with the agricultural economy and the state of immigration in the United States. Stigma in Lafayette County is especially strong due to the occurrence of a triple homicide in April of 2013 that was committed by a stranger to the community with a mental health history. Transportation to and from appointments and support groups outside the county is difficult due to the lack of public transportation. There is also a distinct lack of community supports geographically located in Lafayette County. An investigation reveals there is no community based care groups for miscarriage, divorce, AODA issues, death, or anger management. The nearest group I could locate is Alcoholics Anonymous coming in at almost 54 miles away. The scientific data and the daily living data both suggest a strong need to increase accessibility, availability and acceptability concerning rural mental health in both Green and Lafayette County.|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0

366|Creating healthy young leaders through exposure to new outdoor |The following Rusk County statistics, as recorded by the 2017 United States Census Bureau, state that 22% of youth ages 5-17 live below the poverty level, and 90% of those youth are enrolled in public school. Rusk County has three public schools and one private school for grades K-8. Approximately 6% of youth, ages 10-19, make up the total population in Rusk County where the median age is 48.6 years old. Each public school in the county provides breakfast for their students, as well as has a free or reduced lunch program. Bruce Public Schools is a Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) participant. According to the Rusk County Community Health Improvement Process: Intervention Proposal, conducted by the UW-Madison School of Nursing, data collected proves that there is lack of physical activity in adults in Rusk County as well as a problem with obesity. Roughly 29% of adults ages 20 and up report having no leisure time with physical activity. That number is 8% higher than the Wisconsin state average. Approximately 31% of adults reported a BMI of 30 or higher, which is the same as the Wisconsin state average. When asked if lack of physical activity and obesity is a problem, 31.3% said yes it is a major problem and 53.4% said it is a moderate problem.Data shows that 82.7% of people in Rusk County reported that being physically active is not an easy or desirable choice, i.e. lack of motivation or time. Of those surveyed, 44.4% said they suffer from health problems that prevent physical activity, and 41.1% said that they cannot easily access, or are unaware of where to go to be physically active. Approximately 37.4% of people surveyed stated that they are unaware of the health risks of obesity. The 2017 Wisconsin High School Youth Risk Behavior Survey reports that 13.7% of youth were obese and 15% were overweight. Of those surveyed, an eye opening number of youth, 44%, were trying to lose weight. According to the National Association of Sport and Physical Education and the American Heart Association, Wisconsin mandates physical education classes for grades K-6 and requires daily recess throughout elementary school. The state also mandates physical education classes in grades 7-12 and requires high schools to provide their students with physical education. The state requires 1.5 physical education credits to graduate high school. Wisconsin Department of Instruction states that quality physical education programs are needed to increase the physical competence, health-related fitness, self-responsibility, and enjoyment of physical activity for all students so that they can be physically active for a lifetime. As you can see from the data above, youth and adults in Rusk County have expressed a want, need, and an unfamiliarity with recreation areas in our community to be active in. Because 44% of the youth population surveyed has expressed that they are trying to lose weight, conversations were had with stakeholders in regards to possibilities of creating new outdoor recreation activities to promote healthy, active lifestyles for youth.|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1
367|Nonpoint Source Pollution Outreach and Education (2019)|Society has made tremendous progress reducing surface and groundwater pollution since passage of the Clean Water Act. In recent decades nonpoint source pollution from agricultural, urban, forested and other land uses remains the single largest cause of ongoing water quality problems. These problems manifest most commonly in Wisconsin as surface water algal blooms and sedimentation and in groundwater as elevated nitrates and other contaminants. These impacts have significant effects on public health, local economies and natural communities.Reducing the impacts on nonpoint source pollution through regulation is, by definition, problematic given the dispersed nature of the pollutants. Therefore, outreach and education plays a prominent role in alternate approaches.

The non-profit Superior Rivers Watershed Association (SRWA) will contribute expertise in involving students in experiential assessments of watershed health and integrity to reinforce the ""Kids Paddle Forest to Lake"" connections.This initiative creates a new youth habitat stewardship program featuring half-day on-the-water field investigations that I teach using safe, 2-seater kayaks, supported by on-land water habitat investigations taught by Chequamegon-Nicolet Forest Service-NGLVC interpretive services specialist and SRWA water quality specialists.Many students have never had meaningful hands on learning experience within an aquatic ecosystem. Through demonstrations and guided discussions delivered in this aquatic ""classroom"", students will explore how historic-to-the-present interactions of economic development, natural resource use, and changing societal needs impact upland forests and the sustainability of the Lake Superior ecosystem. They will engage in hands-on water quality experiments and habitat assessments to evaluate the impacts of forest management on downstream aquatic habitats.Students will gain confidence in being in an on-the-water learning environment and interacting with aquatic resources. They will explore the importance of forests in supporting water quality, wildlife habitat, and recreation within a watershed and learn how they strengthen their stewardship of these resources.This initiative is supported by a $10,000 US Forest Service grant through 2019."|0|1|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

Therefore, outreach and education plays a prominent role in alternate approaches. The Regional Natural Resources Program employs a variety of responses to this challenge, primarily through a contractual relationship with the Wisconsin DNR Nonpoint Source Program (DNR NPS).Specifically, my contractual work with the DNR NPS program includes education and outreach to farmers in the Rock River basin. Of this basin, 60% of the land use is for agriculture, and agriculture accounts for 64% of total phosphorus and 89% of total suspended solids on an average annual basis. To address this, the concept of soil health has been widely promoted as it can lead to increased infiltration that would reduce runoff and improve water quality. To promote soil health and water quality, farmer-led groups have formed in the Rock River basin. These groups host successful educational programs, but the groups have challenges in building organizational capacity. Additionally, I met with a stakeholder group from Jefferson county, and they are interested in having more educational programs in the county that are focused on soil health. To address these needs, I will be planning various soil health outreach events in Jefferson county, and work with farmer-led groups to help them build organizational capacity.|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
370|Organizational Development (Strategic Planning, Asset Mapping/N|In Wisconsin, approximately 12% of the state workforce is employed in nonprofit organizations. The revenue generated by these organizations (and secondary impact of wage earners) place the sector as an important contributor to the economy. We know nonprofits at their best are foundational pillars of vibrant communities. Increasingly, nonprofits are asking how they can go beyond meeting basic needs and providing services, and instead work toward addressing core causes in order to alleviate societal problems.In Dane County, nonprofits have a significant presence in the community: there are over 2,800 organizations (501c3 public charities) together drawing over $5 billion in annual revenue. (Davey, Sifting Through Abundance, 2018). The range of issues these organizations address is broad, including: improving education, reducing poverty and providing affordable housing, strengthening the health care support system, protecting and enhancing natural resources, and sustaining the arts. The ability of nonprofits to make substantial and lasting impacts on these issues, however, depends on their organizational capacity and the skills and training of staff. Many employees and volunteers -- including board members -- have not received training in non-profit governance nor organizational or program management. Oftentimes professionals starting in nonprofit management learn the skills necessary for running an organization from sporadic experimentation or harried individual research and networking. Extension Dane County provides assistance to non-profit organizations in the form of strategic planning, facilitation, program planning, and evaluation. Consulting efforts with individual non-profit organizations are high touch and time extensive. In particular, strategic planning work can take from 6-12 months. These high-touch efforts are valuable, but their reach is limited.In order to address the needs of non-profit organizations in the county, my programming in this area will touch on three different aspects for 2019. (1) Direct work with organizations along a consulting for capacity development model; (2) Research to more fully understand the environment/extent of non-profit serving organizations and to determine training and resource needs; (3) Revision of strategic planning methodologies, based on current research and informed by practice, and documented in a usable strategic planning manual.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

These programs are aligned with local, state and national standards and incorporate literacy and STEAM. Programs are available year round and are small fee for service. Program sites include Wehr Nature Center, Milwaukee County Parks, local schools and Libraries.Many Milwaukee Public School teachers and those in the surrounding suburbs do not have the science content knowledge and management training to take students on outdoor field experiences. Wehr/Outreach provides those opportunities by working with the teachers and tailoring experiences to meet their classroom needs. Providing these environmental education experiences enhances knowledge, creates a sense of place, and builds awareness of the rich natural resources available in SE Wisconsin and how to care for them. All of this helps create the base for an environmentally literate adult.This is a group plan of work for the 3 Milwaukee County and 5 UWEX staff that provide these experiences.|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
373|Leadership Training - Community Leadership Alliance of Southwes|Ideas are easy but implementation of ideas requires effective, dedicated, and skilled leaders. Finding people willing and prepared to accept leadership positions, whether formal or informal, is a challenge everywhere but it is often more acute in rural areas. A rural area like ours has a stable but somewhat stagnant base of citizens. Plus our population is aging which puts more of a leadership burden on an ever smaller number of younger and often inexperienced individuals. Extension leaders in Grant, Iowa, and Lafayette Counties along with the Platteville Area Chamber of Commerce and the University of Wisconsin - Platteville recognized this challenge and combined their resources to create a program to address this issue. 20 years ago they formed the Community Leadership Alliance with the intent of providing locally based and locally focused training for existing and emerging government, business, and volunteer leaders in our tri-county area. Today that program plays a significant and ongoing role in the development of individuals who will serve the future of our area. Extension continues to play a lead role in both the ongoing development and delivery of the CLA program.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

(National: 45%)[3] We know that families perform a variety of key functions that contribute to both the mental and physical health of individuals as well as the public health and functioning of society. Throughout all developmental stages, from the prenatal period to the last years of life, strong healthy relationships help families effectively and efficiently raise healthy children, care for vulnerable members, and sustain productive workers and contributing community members. Children who are born into and raised in an environment of positive relationships have a strong foundation that can help them develop into healthy adults and productive citizens. This environment of relationships involves not only parents and children but also extended family and social networks, schools and childcare providers, and others who engage with the family.

377|Promoting the social-emotional well-being of children and famil|According to the Census Population Estimates, Florence County has 4,456 permanent residents. With a racial and ethnic makeup as follows: 99.7% white, 0.3% two or more races, 0.3% black or African American, 0.9% Hispanic or Latino and 0.3% American Indian and Alaska Native. The median age of Florence County is 52.1. Research is clear that strong family and other interpersonal relationships significantly contribute to the health and well-being of individuals across the lifespan. Programs for individuals across the lifespan help build strong relationships within supportive communities, which directly improve outcomes for children, parents, and society. Healthy relationships help children and families thrive.Children who are born into and raised in an environment of positive relationships have a strong foundation that helps them develop into healthy adults and productive citizens. Programs that focus on humans across the spectrum help prevent children having a high ACEs score and decreases exposure to stressors. Divorce/parental separation has become an increasingly common experience for children. Research shows parental conflict is the primary cause of child problems related to separation, divorce, or family transition. Wisconsin statue gives family courts the authority to mandate Co-Parenting programs for couples who are separating. These programs are built upon the belief that a family is an ongoing system of interconnected members. Family members are not identical to each other, and you cannot interact with one without thinking of the others.In 2015, Florence County had 34 divorces (dhs.wisconsin.gov). Divorce/parental separation has become an increasingly common experience for children. Due to a high divorce rate, the opioid epidemic, and other life transitions, we are also seeing an influx of Grandparents raising Grandchildren in Florence County. Through stakeholder and participant conversations, kinship care is reaching out for further support and resources. Families perform a variety of key functions that contribute to both the mental and physical health of individuals as well as the public health and functioning of society. Strong healthy relationships are a contributing factor to health in all ages and stages of development. Individuals and families in communities who strive within these connections and relationships have strong foundations that can help them grow into productive citizens. Stakeholder and partnership conversations in Florence County expressed the need for co-parenting workshops.|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0
378|Lake Superior National Estuarine Research Reserve Research and |The Lake Superior Reserve is situated on the freshwater estuary at the confluence of the St. Louis River and Lake Superior, the largest and most pristine of the Great Lakes. An expansive system, it forms the river mouth of the largest US tributary to Lake Superior. The St. Louis River Estuary contains diverse estuarine habitats and interfaces with urban areas and a busy industrial port, allowing for extensive research opportunities. The Reserve encompasses 16,697 acres of land and water that are significant to supporting the Reserve's goals and protects the integrity of core areas for long-term research and monitoring. Although there are multiple universities, federal, state and local agencies, and tribal governments conducting research and monitoring in the St. Louis River, there are several scientific barriers that prevent informed management and decision making. The Research Advisory Board has identified the Research and Monitory Program as filling a unique niche within the Superior - Duluth research community. The program is designed to foster collaboration among all the various research, monitoring, and management entities and identify further research needs.

379|Dairy Management and Nutritional Strategies to Lower Farming's |Brown County is uniquely characterized by its strong urban population and rural agricultural community. The demographics of Brown County are also changing to include a greater population of Hispanic residents and also an increase in Hispanic workers on farms. Home to both Green Bay and 20 concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), there is a great need for limiting the environmental impact caused by farms through improved farm management practices but not at the economic expense of the farm. Brown County agriculture provides 17,045 jobs to its residents and accounts for $4.6 billion in economic activity. Agriculture pays $80.8 million in taxes and contributes $1.28 billion to county income. Especially at a time of depressed commodity prices across all farming enterprises, it is important to support the agricultural industry through these trying times. In order to maintain a strong agricultural industry, greater workforce development and training resources are needed, especially with a bilingual component to support the growing Hispanic workforce population on farms. In addition, growing suicide rates among farmers has created a need for mental health awareness education and strategies for coping with stress.It is also important to create more positive relationships and better understanding between city residents and the agricultural community through agricultural literacy education. In recent years, news headlines featuring manure spills, resident and community complaints against farms, and general discontentment between city/non-agricultural residents and farmers/agricultural community have become more and more prevalent. This region of the state in particular is under great scrutiny and so are its farming practices. Residents are demanding to know what is being done to improve farming practices, especially as it relates to the environment.In January 2015, this educator conducted a needs assessment survey regarding agricultural and agricultural literacy educational topics in Brown County. A total of 39 agriculture surveys were completed by Brown county residents and regional agribusiness owners/employees. The survey identified five top general areas of importance by those surveyed. They are forages, nutrient management, soil health, dairy, and water quality. One of the top educational needs for farm business management was employee management education. A separate survey was conducted to identify the educational needs regarding agricultural literacy education. Fifty-four people completed the survey, and results showed that people want to learn more about where their food comes from and how farms affect the environment.Based on this information, this agent will focus on dairy and farm management; dairy conservation nutrition; and agricultural employee workforce development to support a struggling agricultural and farming industry for the 2019-program planning year.|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

Adults in stable relationships have better health outcomes, greater financially stability, a greater sense of well-being and improved capacity to provide care for vulnerable family members. It has long been understood that a strong parent/child relationship is a key factor in preventing negative outcomes for children. The need for effective, high quality parent education programs remains a high priority in Wisconsin and Pierce County. There is a growing need among parents, professionals, community leaders and citizens for educational opportunities and technical assistance that can expand their knowledge and skills about child rearing.|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0

While there are examples of collaborative water quality programs supported by other agencies, there is a need to expand extension collaborative programming and partnership among state and tribal land-grants.The tribal collaboration team is working to fill the gap in collaborative programming between state and tribal land-grant institutions. The North Central Region Water Network provides funding support, strategic guidance, communication support, and evaluation support for the tribal collaboration team, with Rebecca Power, Anne Nardi, and Amber Mase providing primary support.|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
382|Using New Media to Expand the Reach of Parenting Education and |Today 90% of Americans are online and 69% of US adults use social media. The average American spends more than 10 hours per day on screen. In fact, smartphones are the great equalizer, providing young adults, racial and ethnic minorities, and those with lower household income levels a connection to the Internet. Parents use mobile devices and social media to seek out parenting tips, interact with other parents, and connect with their children. Research shows that digital media can be an effective educational tool for influencing positive parenting change. Results from our digital parenting educational programs show that parenting programs delivered via new media like text messages, blogs, video, and social media can increase parents' knowledge about child development and parent-child relationships and boost social and informational connections for parents. New media holds strong promise for embodying the Wisconsin idea and bringing applicable knowledge and skills to all parents and caregivers of children. However, our digital programs do not adequately reach historically underserved populations such as Spanish-speaking parents, low-income parents, and families separated due to divorce or other life circumstances. Our online programs reach primarily English-speaking, middle income families. Yet that demographic is an incomplete picture of Wisconsin's population. Hispanics compose 18% of the US population and are the 2nd largest and fastest growing minority racial and ethnic population in Wisconsin. The poverty rate is increasing statewide and most children live with one of their biological parents. By expanding the reach and impact of our outreach to underserved populations, Wisconsin parents and caregivers will more fully benefit from our online educational offerings.|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0
383|Enabling community development through community organizations'|Community development in Waushara County is primarily accomplished by community organizations made up of volunteers who have either joined or been elected the organization. Very few of these organizations have staff, so their work must be carried out by the volunteer board/commission and members of the organization. There are about 500 IRS recognized nonprofits, 25 lake organizations, and 25 municipalities. These organizations provide services in Waushara County to improve and maintain the local quality of life and enhance the local economy.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
384|Addressing Leadership and Organizational Development Challenges|"This program plan was prioritized based on the continued need to raise the majority of my salary and benefits from sources outside of the UW-Madison Division of Extension's budget with grants, contracts and fees for educational services. This is my 15th year operating within this type of budgeting plan. In 1999, the Wisconsin Legislature expanded comprehensive planning with the ""Smart Growth"" law, providing a framework for communities to develop, adapt, implement and amend plans. Nine elements to be addressed include: Issues and Opportunities, Housing, Transportation, Utilities and Community Facilities, Agricultural/Natural/Cultural Resources, Economic Development, Intergovernmental Cooperation, Land Use and Implementation. According to the State of Wisconsin's comprehensive planning law, adopted comprehensive plans are to be reviewed and updated at least once every 10 years (Section 66.1001(2)(i)). Upon review of the City of New Berlin's 2020 Plan, previous work done with consulting group left staff with many questions about data sources and analysis. Through numerous conversation with their Planning Department, a decision was made to work with Extension staff to provide an educational service and support through updating the 2030 plan. This process also seeks to increase staff capacity for data analysis in future efforts for updating their plan. UW-Extension will assist the city by coordinating with staff to update the plans demographics and statistics, to make the document more user friendly. This effort will be done in cooperation with the Plan Commission to also prepare for community conversations amongst key challenges identified."|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
385|Interpreting Climate, Ecology and Culture for the Apostle Islan|Apostle Islands is the only Lakeshore in the National Park Service that exists primarily on islands (94% of the land base) in Lake Superior, the world's largest freshwater body (by surface area). However, this unique location and marine context puts the park at greater risk from climate change; Lake Superior is one of the fastest warming lakes in the world due to the combination of increasing summer air temperatures and decreasing winter lake ice. This has strong potential to alter natural disturbance regimes and subsequently the parks rare ecosystems and species. Furthermore, unlike mainland parks, Apostle Islands could face decline of forest ecosystems coupled with poorly understood potential for immigration of southerly species due to the barrier of Lake Superior.The impacts of climate change on the vulnerability of Apostle Islands National Lakeshore (APIS) ecosystems and resources is being conducted by the Northern Institute of Applied Climate Science combined with information from literature reviews, climate change projections, ecosystem modeling, and an expert panel to identify climate associated vulnerabilities. This project is a $22,000 grant funded partnership with APIS to review results of the APIS Ecosystem Vulnerability Assessment and develop effective interpretive messaging and education outreach to target audiences including visitors, teachers for outreach to youth, and the general public. The project will increase their awareness of climate impacts and vulnerabilities on the Park's terrestrial resources, how the National Park Service (NPS) is addressing these impacts through adaptation practices, and how these audiences can make choices to reduce climate change and promote Park stewardship. Deliverable include design of exhibits and web-based outreach to outreach interpretive themes and messages, and a 1-day teacher workshop will train educators to teach about climate impacts and adaptation strategies using place-based examples from APIS climate vulnerability research. The integration of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and partnerships with tribal educators will be fostered to assure culturally relevant content, programming, and outreach.|0|1|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

388|Promoting the Social-Emotional Well-being of Children and Famil|"According to the 2010 Census, Pierce County has a total population of 41,019 (est. 41,901 in 2017) with a racial and ethnic makeup as follows: 97% white, 1.3% two or more races, .7% Asian, .6% black, .4% American Indian and 1.5% Hispanic or Latino. Because of its geographic location on the west-central border of the state, it is considered part of the Minneapolis-St. Paul MN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area.A variety of factors contribute to the health of Pierce County residents. As shown in the County Health Rankings Model from the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, there are four major health factors that shape health. Those factors and relative percent weight on shaping health are health behaviors, 30%; clinical care, 20%; social and economic factors, 40%; and physical environment, 10%. In the current rankings (2018), Pierce County ranks 39 of 72 for health behaviors with a higher than state average for excessive drinking and alcohol-impaired driving deaths; and 67th for physical environment with 43% of individuals driving alone with long commutes to work compared to 27% for the state. We have a very low ratio of population to mental health providers with a ratio of 2,430:1 opposed to the state at 560:1. (http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/) According to the local Sherriff's office and Department of Human Services there has been a marked increase in drug use cases resulting in out of home placement for children.Individuals and families need knowledge and skills to make healthy decisions in all of these health factors. They also need community supports and environments, as well as systems and policies to assure that the healthy choice is the easiest choice for them and their families. Health initiatives often focus on downstream symptoms like obesity, depression and addiction as the cause of poor health, rather than upstream exposures that precede the emergence of these symptoms. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been identified as some of the most significant precursors to poor long-term health. Paired with the systemic inequities caused by adverse community environments (Ellis, W., & Dietz, W., 2017) such as poverty, violence, poor quality housing, discrimination, limited economic mobility, etc., individuals lose hope and community vitality plummets leading to pressing health crises like the current opioid epidemic. ""Improving community health takes partnerships, time, and commitment. It takes sustainable changes to policies, systems and environments. It takes problem-solving and innovation. It takes all of us working together toward a shared goal."" (http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/what-is-health) UW-Extension has the ability and will to build organizational capacity to strengthen 1) community resilience and vitality and 2) individual protective factors to reduce toxic stress and adverse childhood experiences. Protective factors are positive conditions in families and communities that strengthen all families and increase their health and well-being. The Center for the Study of Social Policy Strengthening Families (https://www.cssp.org/young-children-their-families/strengtheningfamilies) identifies the following five protective factors: Parental resilience, social connections, concrete support in times of need, knowledge of parenting and child development, and social and emotional competence of children. Research studies support the idea that when these protective factors are strong in a family, the likelihood of child abuse and neglect decreases. Due to ongoing economic conditions including low commodity prices, high production costs and rising debt levels, many Wisconsin farmers are facing increased financial and emotional stress. This chronic stress affects individual health and wellbeing as well the relationships they have with family, friends and even service providers (e.g. lenders, crop consultants, sales representatives, etc.). Extension has the capacity to address this issue with a, multi-level, cross-disciplinary response.

390|Building Resilience by Supporting Safe, Stable, & Nurturing Rel|Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are a serious health and economic issue nationwide and in Bayfield County. Exposure to extreme or prolonged stress in childhood is associated with changes in brain development that impact behavior and health. These changes can contribute to a lifetime of challenges, such as poor adaptation to stress, poor social functioning, physical and behavioral health problems, financial problems and even early death. Many of these challenges result in increased demand on community resources such as assistance programs and the criminal justice system. They also contribute to health, education and criminal justice inequities related to race, location and poverty. Yet many individuals and families remain resilient in the face of these stressors. Research supports the importance of safe, stable, nurturing relationships (SSNR's) and several other key protective factors in building resilience, improving health and reducing harm from exposure to adversity. Examples of childhood stressors that are especially impactful in Bayfield County include poverty, high levels of family conflict, exposure to domestic violence, substance abuse, child abuse/neglect. This information is drawn from statewide data, nterviews and data gathered through the county Criminal Justice dept, Red Cliff Tribal Court, the Bayfield, Ashland Iron Counties Community Health Needs Assessment and other county and tribal family serving agencies. Poverty is a key source of toxic stress in Bayfield County. The percent of children in poverty is 22% compared with a statewide rate of 16%. (County Health Rankings and Roadmaps). The county faces the challenges of a rural economy with few high paying jobs. According to the Dec 2018 WI Dept of Workforce Development report, Bayfield County had the highest unemployment rate among counties in the state. Median household income in the county is $50,110, compared to the state median of $56,759. According to the MIT Living Wage Calculator a family of two children and two working adults must earn $64,788 annually to meet basic living expenses without assistance programs in Bayfield County. A single parent must earn over $59,056. These wages are well above median earnings and the wages offered in the typical service industry, hospitality, farming and support positions most commonly available in the county. Substance use disorders take a major toll on residents of Bayfield County. Substance addictions, particularly to meth, are resulting with a dramatic increase in out-of-home placements for children. This contributes to additional exposure to stress for children and their caregivers, many of whom are grandparents and other older adults. It is also putting a major strain on county funds. Substance abuse is a multi-faceted problem, but research is clear that healthy family relationships and social connections are protective factors. Another source of toxic stress for children in Bayfield County revolves around high conflict family relationships. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that high levels of parental conflict are related to negative outcomes for children. In a recent survey by the Bayfield County Criminal Justice Department, 99 percent of Bayfield County Jail inmates reported a history of family violence in childhood. While family conflict and family violence are complex issues, an environment of healthy relationships and strong social emotional skills,have an important role in prevention.The importance of healthy relationships includes not only adult/child relationships but also those between adults and other adults. Social connections for adults play a key role in interrupting the cycle of child maltreatment. (Children Benefit When Parents Have Safe Stable Nurturing Relationships, CDC, 2013). Relationships with romantic partners, friends, extended family and other social supports contribute to positive outcomes for parents and their children. Safe, Stable, Nurturing Relationships protect from negative outcomes in two ways: 1. They help prevent many sources of toxic stress in the first place and, 2. In the face of adversity, they have been shown to serve as a buffer that mitigates damage to children from a prolonged stress response. (Defining Toxic Stress from a Community Perspective, Center for the Study of Social Policy). To build awareness around and address sources of toxic stress, Bayfield County Human Development & Relationships programming is framed around the Center for Study of Social Policy's Strengthening Families Protective Factors: hese five factors: Parental Resilience, Social Connections, Social Emotional Skills, Parenting Knowledge and Concrete Support in Times of need are shown to enhance child development and reduce the likelihood of child maltreatment. They are also important to the well-being of all families, not just those at risk.|1|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0
391|Increase Social and Emotional Wellbeing for Youth and Families |"Dunn County Situation StatementThis situation statement will provide an overview of an ongoing assessment of Dunn County, a primarily rural county with a pocket of urbanization, located in northwestern Wisconsin. The following will include, (1) a brief review of Dunn County demographics and social statistics, (2) discussion on protective factors and how improving social emotional skills enhances long-term community wellbeing and economic outcomes, (3) four research informed strategies to increase social and emotional wellbeing in youth and families based on local needs, and (4) how these strategies align with the vision of both Dunn County and UW-Extension.Demographics and Social StatisticsThe following is a brief review of general demographics and social statistics of Dunn County. This is not an exhaustive detail of the county, however, four main points including (1) population, (2) race and ethnicity, (3) poverty and ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) rates, and (4) ACEs (Adverse Childhood Experiences) statistics will be addressed to discuss local needs.Population and Geographic ConcentrationDunn County is home to 44,603 Wisconsin residents and the population is steadily growing, increasing by 10% from U.S. Census data in 2000. This county is geographically rural with a concentrated urban population in the city of Menomonie. The most recent U.S. Census data (2010), with urban to rural populations, indicated a ratio of 40.0% of residents living in urbanized areas to 59.3% in rural. The largest municipality in the county, the City of Menomonie, which is also the county seat and the only incorporated municipality with an urban population, represents just over 88% of the total urban population in the county. The urban population is further concentrated in the center of the county as all towns with an urban population border the City of Menomonie, including the towns of Menomonie, Tainter, and Red Cedar which make up the other 12% of the urban population.Race and Ethnicity According to the Applied Population Lab, Dunn County's population by race and ethnicity is estimated as the following 93.3% White alone (not Hispanic or Latino), 2.2% Two or more races (not Hispanic or Latino), 2.1% Asian alone (not Hispanic or Latino), 1.7% Hispanic or Latino (of any race), 0.4% Black or African American alone (not Hispanic or Latino), and 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native alone (not Hispanic or Latino). Just over 4% of the population speaks a language other than English at home.Income, Poverty, and ALICE The median household income for Dunn County is $49,788 and the per capita income is $24,098; both lower than the state averages. The poverty rate for the county is higher than the state at 13.5% to 12.1%, respectively. A more holistic picture of finical demographics includes, ALICE an acronym for Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed, are households that earn more than the Federal Poverty Level, but less than the basic cost of living for the county. Combined, the number of poverty and ALICE households equals the total population struggling to afford basic needs. In 2014 Dunn county's average below the ALICE Threshold was 43%, this number increases in specific towns experiencing economic and social distress, for example the town of Wheeler had 70% of the population below the ALICE Threshold. Similarly, the town of Knapp had 58%, Menomonie had 57%, and the town of Boyceville 53% below the ALICE Threshold. Dunn County experiences a slightly higher amount of households below the ALICE Threshold at 43% while across Wisconsin, 42% of households struggled to afford basic household necessities.ACEs and Socioeconomic Status The Wisconsin Ace Brief (2012) defines an ACE or Adverse Childhood Experience as ""a traumatic experience, which occurs prior to the age of 18, such as child physical or sexual abuse, having an incarcerated household member, exposure to domestic violence or parental divorce."" Approximately 58% of Wisconsin residents have experienced at least one ACE, with14% experiencing 4 or more. There is significant comprehensive research that concludes the higher the number of ACEs the greater the risk for long term social, emotional, and cognitive impairment, as well as higher adoptions of healthy-risk behaviors (e.g. smoking, alcohol and drug abuse), and which leads to an increased risk in disease, disability, and social problems. Overall these risks and ripple effects may lead to early death. Dunn County's ACEs or Adverse Childhood Experiences ranking is relatively high. The Wisconsin ACE Brief identifies Dunn County as having 15-20% of the county's adult residents have four or more ACEs. ACES have been strongly linked to a wide range of negative outcomes (mentioned above) in adulthood that impacts the community as a whole. Furthermore, ACEs are also strongly associated with poverty and ALICE rates. The Wisconsin Ace Brief (2012) indicated adults with $25,000 or less in yearly income are 27 percent less likely to report zero ACEs, and almost twice as likely to report 4 or more. In addition, there is also a disparity for high level ACEs and race. According to the study on Racial Disparities in Child Adversity in the U.S.: Interactions With Family Immigration History and Income ""across all groups, black and Hispanic children were exposed to more adversities compared with white children"". However, there is hopeful news, high levels of ACEs in our community is not an end all be all. There is a concept of ""protective factors"" that lead to increased resiliency that can outweigh the negative long term impacts of Adverse Childhood Experiences."|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0

393|Health & Well-being among Vulnerable Populations|Oneida, Vilas and Forest Counties includes a large number of vulnerable populations, including a high and increasing aging population, children from low-income homes, economically challenged, those with chronic health conditions, as well as three tribal communities. According to data collected for the Forest, Oneida, and Vilas Counties Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) the averaged cancer Incidence rate in Oneida, Vilas and Forest Counties is 191 per 100,000 people, with Vilas and Oneida's incidence and mortality rates being the highest in the state. The Obesity rate is also quite high with an average of 31% in the three county area. One of the three county CHIP priority areas is Chronic Disease Prevention and Management. The Health & Well-being Extension Educator will intentionally align work to meet the goals and objectives Northwoods CAN!, the chronic disease prevention coalition.

394|Digital Literacy and Broadband Access (2019)|The Microsoft and 4-H Digital Ambassadors partnership empowers youth to help close the broadband internet gap. Currently in the U.S. there are 23.4 Million people who lack broadband internet access. Access is only half of the problem, feeling secure and knowledgeable enough to adopt and use the technology is the other half. This partnership will elevate teens as teachers to provide training and communication to assist adults in their community with increasing their comfort level in utilizing new technology. This will empower the adults to truly adopt and use technology to improve their opportunities and outcomes. 4-Her's serve as a trusted voice and have many long-standing relationships within their communities, which create an effective training environment and build a compelling movement throughout the community. This work will have profound effects in education, workforce development and community sustainability.In addition to the programmatic training, the youth leaders (Digital Ambassadors) will be trained as spokespeople to lift up and expand youth voice in this critical conversation. This will ensure their experiences as well as hopes and dream for their communities are heard. The youth leaders will host a minimum of six to ten (6-10) learning sessions in their community by June of 2020.|0|1|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
395|Building Community Capacity to Strengthen Families and Increase|"Empowering citizens to identify and address community problems through networking, coordination, prevention and collaboration across county lines and in urban and rural settings, was the theme of the 2013 visioning session that took place in Eau Claire County. ""The future of any society depends on its ability to foster the health and well-being of the next generation. Stated simply, today's children will become tomorrow's citizens, workers, and parents. When we invest wisely in children and families, the next generation will pay that back through a lifetime of productivity and responsible citizenship. When we fail to provide children with what they need to build a strong foundation for healthy and productive lives, we put our future prosperity and security at risk."" (Center on the Developing Child, Harvard) With this in mind, building our community with the goal of improving family life and childhood experiences creates a coordinated effort to strengthen families and build futures for our community. Science tells us that meeting the developmental needs of children is just as much about building a strong foundation for lifelong physical and mental health as it is about enhancing readiness to succeed in school. By leading and participating in coalitions and action teams focused on prevention and early intervention, we can grow the knowledge base and develop new strategies across multiple domains to strengthen families and increase the health and well-being of families. Results from the 2014 health survey, as well as results from health surveys from the past three years have shown that mental health continues to be a top priority of community members in the Eau Claire area. The Chippewa Valley is 90% done with the 2018 community health assessment, and that too is showing that mental health is still our community's number one health priority. About 75% of people in Eau Claire County with mental health conditions receive no treatment at all for their mental illness. Community members have identified the complexity of navigating the mental health system as a major barrier to receiving treatment. Nationally, as many as one in five children has a diagnosable mental health issue and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA) estimates the US prevalence of childhood Serious Emotional Disturbance (SED) as one in eight children. In Wisconsin, approximately one in 10 children qualifies as having a SED. The general population is beginning to understand children's mental health as less an absence of pathology but instead a state of social, emotional and mental well-being which includes the ability to develop friendships and connections with others; participate with confidence in school, the family, and the community; regulate emotions; and maintain high self-esteem with knowledge that one matters in the world. In 2016, Eau Claire City-County Health Department and the Chippewa County Health Department received a grant titled, ""Mental Health Matters"" to improve behavioral health of children in the Chippewa Valley. Through my role serving on the Mental Health Action Team, I was asked to participate in the Mental Health Matters Steering Committee. Our group is assessing community needs, resources and feasibility of implementing programs and policy changes to impact children's mental wellness. My role on this grant and other mental health initiatives is to promote the health and well-being of individuals, families, and communities of Eau Claire County through collaborative and focused action on education, prevention, building upon the community strengths of diversity and resources, leading community assessment, planning, implementation and evaluation. Also, in 2015 I was able to conduct the Family Needs Assessment to better understand the needs and strengths of families and individuals in our community. The survey was distributed to individuals in Eau Claire and Chippewa counties. Based on the results of that survey, my work will continue to grow with the needs of families, serving in a role that will support this research. The survey resulted in 672 respondents. Key findings indicated that chronic stress was the number one area in which families could use additional support, and that mental health ranked as the highest area of need for families. Co-chairing the Mental Health Action Team, serving on the steering committee for the Mental Health Matters grant, co-chairing the Education/Awareness subcommittee and providing leadership and education around mental wellness is an important part of my current and future programming. The work in building community capacity has a direct relationship with the Human Development and Family Relationships Team. Locally and statewide, we work to strengthen the family and enhance the relationships within it in order to raise healthy children, care for vulnerable members, and sustain productive workers and residents who contribute to community life and a civil society. The work of the team recognizes that families do not exist in isolation and that they are influenced by the many settings, institutions, norms, and policies that surround them. The team's work strives to understand these influences so that it can provide educational programs, professional development, community initiatives, and local leadership that strengthen the family's ability to perform its critical functions."|1|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0
396|Adopting Profitable Agricultural Practices which Enhance Enviro|"Iowa County was founded in 1829 and has 23,000 residents (2012 Census). While still a rural county it is becoming a commuter community to a metro area (Dane County) and sits within a circle of some 75 million consumers within a 5 hour drive. The county is located in the un-glaciated, southwestern corner of the state, dominated by a gently rolling to steep, rugged terrain, recognized for its' scenic beauty along with productive farmland. The majority of the county is underlain by highly fractured limestone and sandstone formations, soil depths range from several inches to several feet. Ground water resources are excellent and many valleys are bisected by small streams and rivers, feeding into the Upper Mississippi River basin. The highly erodible topography, soil, and sub soil make this landscape fragile to degradation of soil and water quality. The 2012 Census of Agriculture, indicates that farm numbers are decreasing(1588), reversing a recent trend observed in the 1990 and 2000 Census of Ag, where more (1813), but smaller farm sizes were reported. There are 1183 farm operations and Census of Ag also demonstrates that less than 50% of farm operators (n=749) derive their income exclusively from farming. The census data infers that 400 farm owners (25%), are not operating their farm.Agent needs assessment of county and township elected officials (n=30), and interviews with ag lenders identified 12 key issues. The highest priorities were - value of farm products, impact of agriculture on the environment in terms of water quality and soil erosion, and farm income for small family farms.A UWEX office needs assessment in 2011 (n=145) identified concerns from farmers and rural landowners about the impact of runoff and manure on water quality and increased soil erosion and sedimentation from more tillage. Regional organization surveys reinforce these concerns. Southwest Badger Resource, Conservation and Development needs assessment survey (2012) (n=98) - soil erosion, surface and ground water quality were identified as the most pressing conservation issue in the region. Southwest Regional Planning Commission implemented a visioning needs assessment (2013) ""Grow Southwest Wisconsin"" and established regional objectives to preserve, sustain, and manage Southwestern Wisconsin's agricultural and natural resources, support education and research related to agriculture, and to conserve water and soil. The consistent concern from farmers and rural landowners over time and about the impact of agriculture on soil and water quality has led to educational programming efforts focused upon the sustainability of agriculture. Recent (2018) rural ground water assessment in Iowa, Grant and Lafayette County has resulted in 42% of rural wells with some form of contamination. Society, rising incomes and growing populations are placing more demands upon agricultural lands to provide safe, affordable food and to reduce US dependence upon imported oil by producing alternative bio-energy products. Unfortunately this contributes to a negative feedback loop, more people equals more food and energy consumed resulting in more intensity of agriculture. More mined fertilizer (limited resource) used at faster rate, more acres cropped more intently (more fuel - limited resource) resulting in more soil (limited resource) erosion. An outcome is lowered capacity of soil to produce food and fuel and collapse. As agriculture increases its' intensity, some production practices will rank higher or worse than others in the degree of effect on soil quality and erosion and impacts on surface and ground water. Iowa County has had the highest level of Conservation Reserve Program acres in Wisconsin, as gross acres and as percent of total crop acres. High commodity prices triggered rapidly increasing lands rental values and have attracted many of these acres back into row crop production. In 2009, the Geological Natural History Survey completed mapping the underground water geography of Iowa County, with depth to bedrock data, creating a 3-D map and potential areas of high concern for groundwater contamination. The shallow upper aquifer is in the most intensive ag area of the county and is highly susceptible to contamination. The deep aquifer is located on the more rugged and rugged landscape. The US Environmental Protection Agency and USGS have identified the Upper Mississippi Basin as a large contributor of nitrogen and phosphorous to the waterway resulting in a growing hypoxia zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Blue Mounds State park is the highest point in southern Wisconsin at 1719', US Highway 18 roughly follows the old Military Ridge with an average elevation of 1200'. Runoff to the south drains into the Pecatonica River system, as this water leaves Iowa County at Blanchardville, it has lost 400' of elevation over a distance of 17 miles. High commodity prices resulting from government incentives, lack of effective enforcement and freedom to farm have encouraged sod busting, the conversion of pasture and transition of CRP acres into row crop production. Current low commodity prices are encouraging producers to work even more land to pay bills, while the best strategy may be to not row crop these marginal acres at all. Forages whether as hay or grazed pasture are ideally suited to address multiple concerns - profit, soil regeneration, improved water infiltration and higher soil health compared with row cropping. Reduced and No-till also further the goal of reducing soil loss and improving water infiltration rates, further adoption of cover crops can push soil building, water infiltration closer to the levels of managed pasture. Nutrient management planning is essential to producers for managing production input costs on fertilizer purchases and understanding soil loss rates on their farm under current and potential improved management. Educating both producers and land owners who control access to a significant portion of ag lands on the value of conservation is imperative lest we repeat the folly of the poor ag practices of the past. By deploying best ag practices, runoff can be reduced, water infiltration can be increased soil maintained and improved. The judicious use of dairy and livestock manure with a carbon source can build soil organic matter and make Iowa County more resilient. Good and improving soil and water quality will maintain and enhance our environment, agricultural productivity and quality of life."|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
397|  Sustainable Agriculture for Douglas County: Nutrient Manageme|"Douglas County has experienced a loss in productive agricultural land over the past 30 years, particularly as most of the dairy farms have discontinued. Presently there are 5 active dairy farms. The majority of the agricultural land is in grassland hay and beef production. The transition out of more intensive agriculture has resulted in the vast number of farming operations relying on ""off farm"" employment to fulfill income needs. At the same time, it has been observed through on farm visits, yearly Dairy Roundtables, facilitating Local Food Coalition gatherings, serving as an advisor on the Douglas County Farmland Preservation Planning Committee, participating in grazing and nutrient management field days and on farm research plots: farmers expend energy and resources on agricultural methods that do not allow the potential economic, environmental or societal return of sustainable agronomic management.A particular need continues to be management of the nutrients for a productive system, both economically and environmentally. Locally, UW- Extension has been able to address these questions by engaging individual landowners, businesses, elected officials with University Wisconsin- Madison Agriculture Specialists in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences to offer education, research and outreach in Farm Management, Dairy Profitability, Agronomy, Soil Science and Community Food Systems.As indicated in the Douglas County Farmland Preservation Plan (2018-2028) and the Douglas County Comprehensive Plan (2010-2030), the County and its citizens consider agricultural land an important land use in its county for economic strength, conservation of their natural resources and a desirable way of life. Sustainability for agriculture is important to maintaining and growing these outcomes. There is a growing awareness that farmers often purchase or rent more grassland acres to meet their forage needs rather than sustainably manage what they own currently. This strategy results in increase infrastructure costs (rent, time, machinery) and results in lower yields, loss of quality forage, decrease in soil health, and valuable time away from family and community.The diversity of population is relatively low in Douglas County, particularly for those that influence the rural land use. This will need to be addressed when gathering data, providing outreach, and gathering input. This should be achieved by engaging the new and young farmer demographic and encouraging non farmers in offering ideas, participating in programing and making decisions for sustainable agriculture outcomes in Douglas County."|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
398|Reality Check Financial and Life Choices Program (2019)|"Buffalo and Pepin are adjacent, rural counties and share a combined total of a little more than 20,500 individuals living in 8,759 households (U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts estimates, July 1, 2016), spread across 1,004 square miles. In both counties, agricultural-related activity is the primary economic base. Statistics show that family composition is mixed, with a greater percentage of single-parent households, unmarried parents and stepfamilies, in comparison to two-parent households. (American Community Survey Profile Report: 2011-2015 5-year estimates). Racial/ethnic composition in Buffalo County is 97.7% white alone; Pepin 98.2%. Although a relatively small percentage, Latino is the predominant minority, and I have utilized partnerships for outreach to connect with Latina-led young families for parenting and relationship education. Alcohol abuse, illegal drug use and mental health are top concerns for residents across both counties. (Great Rivers United Way COMPASS NOW 2015 Survey; Buffalo County Community Needs Assessment, 2015; Pepin County Community Health Improvement Plan 2016-2020; Buffalo County Community Health Improvement Plan 2016-2020). According to the National Provider Identification Registry, there were no mental health care providers available in Buffalo County prior to 2015. There are now two part-time mental health providers available in Buffalo and Pepin counties, with a patient to provider ratio of 6,679:1, compared with the WI state average ideal patient to provider ratio of 623:1. The lack of access to mental health services is a problem for families and individuals.Both Buffalo and Pepin counties face a dramatic doubling (from 15% to 30%) of residents age 65 and older by the year 2035. A need to prepare aging-friendly communities has been expressed among local government and agency partners, and will be a part of future programming planning. (This may become a secondary programming priority).Median household income is $50,196 and $49,516 for Buffalo and Pepin counties respectively. However, there are wide disparities between age groups, ranging from $16,917 for younger adults to $63,182 for seniors (U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts estimates, July 1, 2016). And, while unemployment rates are low, so are high-paying ""living wage"" jobs (livingwage.mit.edu, living wage calculator, 2017). Only 4% of Buffalo County respondents rated the availability of jobs with wages that offer a good standard of living; 74% responded poor or fair (2015 United Way: Buffalo County Random Household Survey). The percentage of high-paying jobs is low and a high household income is not enjoyed by most residents. The UW-Extension 2018 Developmental Situational Analysis process for Area 9 identified AODA and health concerns, and building skills for healthy family relationships, stability and well-being as two of the top five priority needs. This was based on a broad representation of stakeholder/partner input and surveys, and is consistent with results of a 2010 formal Survey of Issues and Themes Impacting WI Families and Communities that I conducted with local partners, as part of a statewide Family Living Program effort. Responses from dozens of partners confirmed my programming focus on education and prevention for family relationships and financial security, especially for vulnerable populations. Local Community Health Improvement Plans, United Way Community Assessments and Youth Risk Behavior Survey data continue to validate these programming priorities.I hold a leadership role within the Institute for Human Development and Relationships by chairing two state efforts: Healthy Relationships, and Correctional Systems Audiences. In order to make the greatest impacts at the local, regional or state levels, it is important that I leverage resources and be clear about my facilitating, research, education, planning and evaluation roles. Where possible, a prevention approach that reached a wide audience has been the foundation of programming efforts and, when necessary or appropriate, intervention strategies have been used. I rely on research and specialist support, as well as multiple sources for assessing current and future community needs. I advance a collective impact with partners and coalitions.Provide educational resources and opportunities about healthy couple, co-parenting and other family relationships parenting, child development, either direct education or contacts, online or through key partners. Specific to the Reality Check program, many of the local schools do not offer life-skills or personal finance courses for students. This program ensures that all students receive essential education and authentic learning experiences toward decision-making, education and career, and personal finance as a successful young adult."|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|1|0
399|Addressing Leadership and Organizational Development Challenges|This program plan was prioritized based on the continued need to raise the majority of my salary and benefits from sources outside of the UW-Madison Division of Extension's budget (with grants, contracts and fees for educational services). This is my 15th year operating within this type of budgeting plan. Jefferson and Waukesha Counties are geographically located between Madison and Milwaukee along the I-94 interstate corridor. Both counties have experienced substantial population growth over the past 35 years. Since 1980, Waukesha County has grown by over 116,000 people and Jefferson County has grown by over 18,000 people. Collectively, in 2016, Waukesha County (396,449) and Jefferson County (84,262) had a combined population of over 480,000 people.Since the spring of 2017, Waukesha County UW-Extension has worked with the Village of Palmyra on understanding demographic trends, understanding their trade area, and connecting small businesses to resources. UW-Extension has connected small businesses in Palmyra to the resources offered by the Small Business Development Center at UW-Whitewater. UW-Extension also conducted small business retention and expansion visits with 22 companies with under 50 employees. Based on what we heard on these visits from business owners, UW-Extension developed three workshops for small businesses in collaboration with a steering committee of the Chamber of Commerce. The majority of this effort was funded by a USDA Rural Development Grant that Waukesha County UW-Extension wrote to provide educational and technical assistance to Palmyra. Palmyra has requested additional assistance from UW-Extension in 2019 to assist them with formulating a plan for a Wisconsin Department of Tourism Joint Effort Marketing (JEM): Destination Marketing grant to better capture visitors from the Kettle Moraine State Forest, Southern Unit. Annually, over 1 million people visit the southern unit of the Kettle Moraine State Forest. Farmers Markets, Parks, Trails, and Pedestrian uses are topics of high interest in attracting and retaining millennials in communities. This remains a continued need with non-profit groups in Jefferson County and an area that UW-Extension has the skill sets to deliver with data analysis, strategic planning, and organization development. Currently, Jefferson County has over 400 registered non-profit organizations.|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

I partner with the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission, and Bad River and Red Cliff Tribes to offer place-based learning, culturally relevant experiences and with state and federal agencies, such as the Northern Institute of Applied Climate Science, to provide additional ""western"" science research. Demand for climate change educational programs based on the G-WOW climate literacy model continues. I continue to offer single and multi-day G-WOW Climate Camps"" for school and youth groups; and present the model to adult audiences on request. In addition, I maintain the G-WOW website (www.g-wow.org) as a online climate training curriculum and repository of climate resources."|1|1|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
401|(2019) Opioid Task Force Programmatic Response #2: Provide comm|Behavioral Health & OpioidsThe misuse of and addiction to opioids is a serious national health crisis that has grown to epidemic status. In 2016, the national rate of opioid related deaths was 13.3 deaths per 100,000. The rate of drug overdose deaths has steadily increased in the last decade. In 2016, national rate of drug overdose deaths was more than three times the rate in 1999.In Wisconsin, the drug overdose death rate is higher than the national average. Wisconsin has a rate of 15.8 deaths per 100,000 or (865 people). This statistic refers to only opioid related deaths. Countless more Wisconsin residents are affected by opioid addiction from those who are currently addicted, to children in foster and kinship care due to neglect and/or abuse associated with their parents' drug addiction. The fallout from addiction includes eviction, homelessness, criminal history, unemployment, adverse childhood experiences (ACES), among many others. These rates are expected to soar with the rise in opioid use.Mental Health First Aid takes the fear and hesitation out of starting conversations about mental health and substance use problems by improving understanding and providing an action plan that teaches people to safely and responsibly identify and address a potential mental illness or substance use disorder.|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0
402|Network Literacy Team, Military Families Learning Network: Addr|Network Literacy (NetLit) helps people become more resilient and adaptive within complex social systems through relationship building, personal growth, and shared work. We do this by creating space for practice, reflection, connection, inquiry, co-learning and collaboration.The term network literacy describes competence in using online networks to learn, teach, create, share, and build both personal and professional communities.Network literacy is an important part of the work of the Military Families Learning Network and specifically the NetLit team because it:Involves how people find information, connect with others, communicate, work, learn, share knowledge, and teach through networks.Investigates and creates understanding of the social, economic, and political implications of knowledge distribution via networks.Focuses on how technology and social networks are influencing and reshaping society.However, the work of the NetLit team extends beyond competence in using online networks.The complex and interrelated issues facing military families, call for emergent and adaptive solutions. NetLit will help MFLN better contribute to these solutions by:Producing and sharing knowledge about complex systems and the role social networks play in building resilience within those systemsCreating learning experiences and spaces for the practice of network building.Facilitating network-wide discussions on creating conditions for engagement and program innovationCollaborating with MFLN concentration areas to support more collaborative, learner-centered, and issue-driven programmingMeasuring and monitoring the health of the MFLN network|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
403|Climate Strong! Building Tribal Youth Leadership for Climate Re|Tribal governments are facing harsh realities as extreme weather, development, and economics threaten not only the sustainability of natural resources but also their culture. Because their culture is intertwined with the land and the plants and animals that living there, tribes face unique challenges in maintaining their cultural practices as a changing climate affects those resources. This initiative is based on the 2019-2021 Climate Strong! $500,000 NOAA grant to the Fond du Lac Tribal and Community College (FDLTTC) to develop a training curricula and outreach for educators and tribal youth to build their leadership in helping their communities build climate resiliency within the 3-state Ojibwe Ceded Territory of Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan. I assisted in developing this grant and initiative and am serving as a Co-Principal Investigator. Other partners include the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC), the 1854 Treaty Authority, and the Lake Superior National Estuarine Research Reserve as a NOAA asset. The project integrates the G-WOW climate literacy model to build awareness of how climate impacts community and cultural systems and build leadership skills to contribute to resiliency strategies through integration of place-based culturally relevant traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and NOAA earth science assets.|1|1|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
404|Through deliberate leadership opportunities early adolescent yo|"National Data: Since the 1990's employers require a mix of soft skills and technical expertise from future employees. Soft skills include interpersonal communication like team work, problem solving and critical thinking. In addition, listening in being able to reflect, summarize, and para phrase what another person is saying. Furthermore, prioritization of work flow, written communication and innovation highlights essential areas. Cognitive skills like reading, writing, and arithmetic is crucial in predicting academic and employment success. In 2008, the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AACU) reported on a multi-year dialogue between employers and institutions of higher learning. In which, each institution must foster a high level of intellectual and practical skills. Garcia, in 2014 confirms the AACU report with employment sectors requiring various skill sets from interpersonal to applied skills. Only one third of graduating students are ready for college or engaging in the workforce (Wagner 2008). Positive youth development programs provide life skill development and the opportunity to apply learned leadership skills. Deliberate leadership activities create opportunities for youth to lead and work with peers and adults. The University of Illinois Extension (Diaz et al, 2015) identified six action areas where youth leaders develop competency in 4-H Youth Development: 1) planning, 2) promoting, 3) teaching, 4) mentoring, 5) advocating, and 6) advising. The 2010 Wisconsin 4-H Youth Leadership study found older 4-H youth demonstrated the following: Individual growth in life skills Youth participation in intentional leadership practices (club officers, committee members, camp counselors, leadership training workshop participants, etc.)  Increased opportunities for in group and teamwork development. A key difference in the expectations of employers going forward revolves around literacy. For today's (and tomorrow's) employers, literacy no longer refers to one's ability to read and write, but their ability to navigate communication platforms, specifically in-person relationships, while navigating the online platforms. Today's youth are born into a world where technology is part of how they learn, communicate, and experience life (Ku 2014). Conversely, soft skills; teamwork, problem solving, critical thinking, listening, and communication skills will keep the workforce moving in a united and upward direction. Wisconsin Data: In Wisconsin, the Governor's office has established workforce development goals that serves as the basis for local/regional responses to economic development and workforce needs, including a plan for youth (Department of Workforce Development 2013). The soft skills, life skills, and leadership skills previously identified align with the Governor's goals for Wisconsin's ""emerging workforce"" - youth (Western Wisconsin Workforce Development Board, Inc. 2014). These skills align with the 4-H youth developments essential elements of Belonging, Independence, Generosity, and Mastery. In addition, the 6 C's of positive youth development: connection, competence, confidence, character, caring, and contribution.4-H Data: 4-H Youth Development has been preparing youth for a successful future outside of school since 1904. Youth leadership and life skills are synonymous with positive youth development. Youth leadership programs provide life skill development and the opportunity to apply learned skills. The 2010 Wisconsin 4-H Youth Leadership study found that older 4-H youth demonstrated individual growth in life skills. Intentional leadership practices found active participation as a club officer, a committee member, a camp counselor, a facilitator of a project area, and more develops independence, and mastery. Purposeful opportunities to work in groups contribute to life skill development. The strongest outcomes in the 2010 Wisconsin 4-H study were in community connectedness and self-efficacy (beliefs about one's capabilities to produce effects). The strongest skill results related to communication, decision-making, and problem-solving skills. Exactly the skills employers are looking for. Local Data:A 4-H youth and adult assessments were conducted in the fall of 2017. The premise for conducting the survey was to identify why Clark County 4-H has difficulty retaining youth over the age of 12. Questions revolved around the priorities youth and parents participate in and outside of 4-H. The respondents identified parallels with 4-H, FFA, Sports, other extracurricular school activities, religious obligations, and work. Challenges experienced in 4-H yielded a range of responses from the risk of failing (not doing well), availability (time), new people, reporting (record books), and uncomfortable with the unknown. The University of Illinois Extension (Diaz et al, 2015) identified six action areas where youth leaders develop competency in 4-H: 1) planning, 2) promoting, 3) teaching, 4) mentoring, 5) advocating, and 6) advising. Clark County 4-H's primary focus has been on teaching and mentoring with older youth and their parents."|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1
405|Building Community Capacity Strengthening Families and  Increas|"The 2017 estimated population of Grant County is 51,999 people, with 96.5% being white, 1.4% Hispanic, and 1.4% black. It has a slightly higher percentage of people aged 65 and older (15.6%) than Wisconsin as a whole and a lower percentage under 18 (21.3%) as compared to Wisconsin as a whole (23.6%). It is a rural county with a population density of 43 people per square mile and experienced a minimal (0.42%) growth rate in the last decade. Grant County has a poverty rate of 15.4%, higher than the 12.5% state average. The medium household income is $49,067, which is well below the national average of $56,516. The child poverty rate is 17%, also higher than the Wisconsin rate of 16%. In Grant County, the proportion of the population receiving FoodShare increased from 2.8% in 2000 to 14.7% in 2015. In Grant County during the same period, the share of school-age children certified for free or reduced price meals grew from 27% to 45%. These economic statistics along with priority issues determined by Grant County UW-Extension needs assessment completed in 2015/16 has assisted in setting a framework for the Grant County Family Living Program. In 2015-2016 Grant County UW Extension partnered with the Survey Research Center (SRC) at the University of Wisconsin at River Falls to conduct a county wide needs assessment. Programming priorities on topics related to the family are more evenly distributed than for any of the other Extension programming areas. There are no clear top priorities for family-focused programming, but the overall average level of importance attached to these topics was higher than all other Extension programming areas. There several topics that about half or more of the respondents felt were very important: personal finances (saving/investing for the future, budgets, debt, credit reports, etc.), child development, identity theft, caring for aging family members, healthy lifestyles (nutrition, physical activity, social and emotional health), coping with family transitions, communication and relationship building. In a comparison with the 2015/16 needs assessment over previous efforts ranked a higher awareness or concern in regards to health & well-being over parenting practices gathered from open ended questioning as noted in the following bullet points.  Discuss and plan how to deal with incursion of drugs, gangs, and crime in Grant County.   Expand substance abuse programs possibly through the court system.  Mental illness treatment for Grant County residents.   Programming for healthy living, lifestyle behavior change, and healthy decision making.  Promotion of health of all aspects i.e. food, physical, mental, relationship, etc.  Find out why cancer is so prevalent in this county.  Healthy lifestyles.After careful consideration of priorities and needs of Grant County, the determined priority program efforts will focus on building community capacity supporting and building family financial security and economic well-being, building family strengths, improving parenting supports and practices, and promoting healthy lifestyles while strengthening the collaborative efforts of all agencies serving families improving outcomes for children, families and society.The profound influence of families on society makes evident the importance of supporting and strengthening families. Issues' relating to parenting or the strengthening of families is nothing new for Grant County UW Extension, but often takes on new forms as parenting issues change with the times. Whether looking at families seeking basic parenting skills, support and prevention of AODA issues or child abuse, families struggling with divorce, couple relationships, connecting to community, or spending quality time together; citizens of Grant County are concerned about families enduring ongoing challenges that remain a fact of life. It is also apparent within Grant County that even though families remain the primary place where children are raised there is increasing evidence that the task is shared by others, and that ""care giving is everyone's business.""Families perform a variety of key functions that contribute to both the mental and physical health of individuals as well as the public health and functioning of society. Throughout all developmental stages, from the prenatal period to the last years of life, strong healthy relationships help families effectively and efficiently raise healthy children, care for vulnerable members, and sustain productive workers and contributing community members. Children who are born into and raised in an environment of positive relationships have a strong foundation that can help them develop into healthy adults and productive citizens. This environment of relationships involves not only parents and children but also extended family and social networks, schools and childcare providers, and others who engage with the family. Stable, nurturing relationships have a powerful protective impact on children. They help prevent exposure to multiple risks and stressors, including family violence and neglect, parental incarceration, and mental illness. Exposure to these stressors is associated with numerous poor outcomes, some of which are commonly seen across multiple generations within families and are very costly to society. In addition to contributing to prevention, safe, stable, nurturing relationships with parents and other caregivers serve as a buffer to help mitigate the damaging impacts of toxic stress. Healthy relationships help children thrive. Adult health and well-being also depend in great part on the quality and success of relationships. Adults in stable relationships have better health outcomes, greater financially stability, a greater sense of well-being and improved capacity to provide care for vulnerable family members, including children and older adults. It has long been understood that a strong parent/child relationship is a key factor in preventing negative outcomes for children. More recent research suggests that strong relationships between parents and other adults, including romantic partners, friends and extended family, can help prevent child maltreatment and improve the capacity of adults to parent effectively. Healthy relationships help adults nurture.For seniors, social connections and strong family relationships are critical to continued well-being and engagement. As the nation and Wisconsin experience a demographic shift toward a greater proportion of older adults, it is critical to invest in programs that keep seniors connected and contributing in their roles as active citizens, caregivers for children and older adults, and as part of the social support system of partners, friends and others. In a recent Community health needs assessment social isolation was identified as an area of concern. Healthy relationships support seniors' well-being.Connecting to the Human Development and Family Relationships Team will assist Family Living in Grant County to strengthen the family and enhance relationships in order to promote lifelong mental, physical and emotional health. Recognizing that families do not exist in isolation and that they are influenced by many settings, institutions, norms, policies, and transitions Grant County Family Living will provide programming which acts on research to ? support caregiver skills across developmental stages,? target periods of significant stress for families and caregivers,? reach learners through traditional and digital methods, and? connect individuals and communities through systems level work."|1|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|1|0|0

Many communities depend on a sustainable forest products industry. As harvesting from industry-owned land decreased, to ensure a continuous timber supply the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) looks toward those who own nearly 70% of the 16 million acres of forested land   private woodland owners.Over ninety percent of the woodland in SW Wisconsin are owned by private woodland owners. The majority of these woodland owners are managing their lands without the help of a conservation professional. The Learn About Your Land program was created as an outreach tool to provide instruction to these woodland owners. Woodland owners who participate in this education program gain insights as to how to enhance sustainable management of their lands.|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

408|Tribes Lead!  Tribal Leadership Development in the Great Lakes |This plan of work element includes two tribal leadership initiatives :Tribal Nations Lead! Tribal Leadership Development in the Great Lakes Region: The Great Lakes North Central Region is home to 56 federally recognized Tribes, 23 of those reside in Michigan and Wisconsin, each with a unique system of governance. Based on federal trust responsibilities the Cooperative Extension services in Michigan and Wisconsin have a responsibility to build relationships and partnerships with the tribal communities that we serve. Community development has been the responsibility of local governments, planners and politicians. But in many communities there is a deep desire for more grass roots involvement in the development of current and future leaders. It is essential for Tribes to develop successional leadership plans within their communities in order to address emerging cultural, economic, and social issues. While there are Cooperative Extension leadership development programs, there is a lack of training that integrates indigenous teachings with western leadership concepts to promote culturally relevant leadership in tribal communities. Likewise, there are important leadership lessons to be learned from Tribal cultures that can be shared to strengthen non-tribal leadership development programs across the region. This initiative is a $20,000 North Central Regional Center for Rural Development (NCRCRD) grant initiative and partnership between UW-Extension and Michigan State University Extension.This project will develop a cross-state collaboration to create a culturally relevant leadership training model for emerging Native American leaders. It will be replicable across the diversity of tribal nations within the North Central region and its outcomes will help enrich leadership training programs for non-native audiences. This project will increase the capacity of land grant institutions by demonstrating how integration of indigenous knowledge with University-based research can strengthen programming and build relationships with tribal communities based on a reciprocity and respect. This project builds on the tribal leadership curriculum and activities developed for the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission's leadership development program listed below.Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC) Leadership Development Program is an on-going relationship to develop the curriculum and training for provide professional leadership development for GLIFWC's Biological Services Division. Training builds on a building capacity for shared leadership management model and integrating traditional ecological knowledge in their western science-based natural resource research and management. As a result of this initiative, additional requests for leadership training from other tribal departments is expected in 2019.|1|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
409|FoodWIse Regional Program Manager-South (2019)|Prior to the creation of the Regional Program Manager position in 2018, there was often a missing connection between the state and county FoodWIse program staff. Connecting counties with state FoodWIse staff helps to create a strong relationship and fulfills the purpose of teamwork. The FoodWIse Regional Program Manager actively supports and works with County Coordinators within their assigned areas to ensure county project educational programs and partnership efforts are within SNAP-Ed Federal Guidance and supported with resources they need to be successful, such as providing coaching, plan development, implementation, evaluation, and reporting. The Regional Program Manager also works collaboratively with the FoodWIse State Coordinator in supporting administrative functions related to human resources and grant program management.|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
410|(2019) Opioid Task Force Programmatic Response #3: Provide Univ|"The misuse of and addiction to opioids is a serious national health crisis that has grown to epidemic status. In 2016, the national rate of opioid related deaths was 13.3 deaths per 100,000. The rate of drug overdose deaths has steadily increased in the last decade. In 2016, national rate of drug overdose deaths was more than three times the rate in 1999.In Wisconsin, the drug overdose death rate is higher than the national average. Wisconsin has a rate of 15.8 deaths per 100,000 or (865 people). This statistic refers to only opioid related deaths. Countless more Wisconsin residents are affected by opioid addiction from those who are currently addicted, to children in foster and kinship care due to neglect and/or abuse associated with their parents' drug addiction. The fallout from addiction includes eviction, homelessness, criminal history, unemployment, adverse childhood experiences (ACES), among many others. These rates are expected to soar with the rise in opioid use.Much of our county-based educators do not have access to a repository of tools that would help them with community requests for assistance on the opioid crisis. Having a ""toolbox"" can help colleagues start to work in the area of the opioid crisis."|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0
411|FoodWIse Regional Program Manager (North Region)|UW Extension programs have a unique and valuable role in assisting individuals and families to improve the nutritional quality of their dietary choices, increase their physical activity levels, and maximize the safety of the food they eat. UW Extension FoodWIse is a federally funded by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program-Education (SNAP-Ed) and the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) and serves Wisconsin residents with limited incomes. FoodWIse employs a combination of evidence-based educational strategies, accompanied by environmental supports, designed to facilitate voluntary adoption of healthy food choices and active lifestyles. FoodWIse works out of county Cooperative Extension offices and in collaboration with state and local partners. FoodWIse is engaged in 66 of 72 Wisconsin counties. SNAP-Ed funds programming in 66 counties.Prior to the creation of the Regional Program Manager position, there was a missing connection between the state and county staff. Connecting counties with state FoodWIse staff helps to create a strong relationship and fulfills the purpose of teamwork. The FoodWIse Regional Program Manager actively supports and works with County Coordinators within their assigned areas to ensure county project educational programs and partnership efforts are within SNAP-Ed Federal Guidance and supported with resources they need to be successful, such as providing coaching, plan development, implementation, evaluation, and reporting.

412|Vegetable Crop Integrated Disease Management 2018|Wisconsin has a long history of specialty crop production and processing, including potatoes and vegetables. This production represents significant economic contribution across Wisconsin's rural and suburban communities. Potato and vegetable, alone, accounts for over $750 million annually. In total, specialty crop production and processing account for more than $5.8 billion of annual economic impact and about 24,500 jobs (Mitchell et al., 2017, Economic impact of specialty crops and irrigated agriculture in Wisconsin). The spectrum of growers producing these specialty crops include both small scale as well as large scale, and organic and conventional. In addition, in my role in disease management extension, I also address vegetable disease concerns of home gardeners. My research program is driven by questions stemming from my extension interactions - and logically - my extension program is fueled by results of my research program which specifically addresses disease management concerns of the numerous grower groups served by my UW-Madison-based integrated research and extension program. Overarching research objectives include: 1) exploration of pathogen ecological factors for improved understanding of disease and its persistence in the environment, 2) development of integrated disease management approaches suitable to specific growing systems of Wisconsin and the region, and 3) advancement of detection and management tools ro reduce reliance upon chemical control inputs to enhance sustainability of healthy food production in our environment.|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|1|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0
