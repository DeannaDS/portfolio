# Data Science Portfolio - Deanna Schneider

This portfolio will contain a variety of data science projects I have completed. Some of the projects constitute work from the [University of Wisconsin Master's in Data Science program](https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/). Additional projects were completed as part of my employment at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Division of Extension.
