These aren't weaknesses of the Program but of human nature. |Technology is always progressing and incorporating that into our paperwork, education and other aspects of the organization. Younger people will relate easily to technology. Older people will appreciate the help of technology.|First obstacle that comes to mind is lack of autonomy. Guidelines and rules are helpful in keeping a group on track but each region has its own strengths and characteristics. These should be embraced without choking the group into submission to be a cookie cut from the same cutter.

Often times the county extension agent is overextended and can't provide the support needed to the ground. It would behoove the program to add additional staff in the way of part-time employee who could provide on-the-ground planning with the master gardener cadre under the direction of the county extension agent.|Provide funding and technical assistance to design table top displays that can be used to go to market this opportunity at fairs, etc. This will strengthen the brand image of the program and help with recruitment. I've seen creative designs from different master gardener groups throughout the state. It would be helpful to have one design instead of dozens. Additionally, provide some latitude for county extension agent projects that master gardeners can do. Our master gardener group works on projects throughout a two-county area and helps numerous small community garden projects. It was recently proposed that there would be more restrictions on project selection. This could impact our rural communities adversely by restricting the number of projects we can assist with. |There may be opportunities to collaborate with the Wisconsin Master Naturalist program.

Socializing with all of the other gardeners has been a wonderful experience for me.|I realize that many of our volunteers are in my age bracket range.  It would be nice to be able to draw younger people.  I suspect that this could be due to the fact that our entire area's population is older on the average.  I am also just thinking that many younger people are still working and have families to care for.  This might be the reason why we don't see a lot of participation by younger people on the peninsula.  Personally, I am not involved in this program with 100% of my time.  I pick and choose what I participate in based upon my time and whether or not I have to drive a long ways to attend a gathering or an assignment.  |I have only been involved for what will be 3 years.

61|Master Gardener Volunteer|0-5|Female|45-64|I love to learn and be able to give back to my community.|I think programs and program criteria should be the option of the county Master Gardener program not the state, as all counties have unique needs and possibilities for community services.  I think the MG program should allow for unique circumstances of inputting learning hours & volunteer hours. It seems that those items are becoming stringently set in the State MG Program.  As in each group being having to have set projects that allowed to be considered as volunteer hours.  In my opionion, the more red tape & over involvement on a state level is going to lead to less MG vounteers and more MG County programs switching to private entities.  Everyone is tired of government involvement.|"I don't really see opportunity--Personally, from what I have heard regarding the ""new"" MG program, I see it shrinking.  It seems the writing is on the wall that the power of the MG Program is switching to a state level vs. staying at the County level with the people who make the program what it is.  It is not about the administration--it is all about the workers, and the workers can volunteer on their own, they don't need the MG Program to continue on that avenue."|answered in previous question.

Recognize and embrace the changing interests in gardening, including sustainability, organic practices, soil building practices, permaculture, etc. |The aging boomer population is a big threat -- we need to find a way to attract younger people into the program and they will require flexible scheduling options. We need to survey them to find out what they think about our organization and what would make our program more appealing to them. The minimum time commitment of volunteer and education hours really scares off younger people who have a family and they don't even consider becoming a MG because of that requirement. We need to find a way to embrace new MGVs even if they aren't able to commit as many hours initially. Over time as they age, their schedules will become more flexible. We have a couple of big competitors: 1) organizations that focus on more 'current' interests, such as vegetable gardening, sustainable gardening practices, etc., and 2) organizations that do not have as much of a bureaucratic overhead and require such a large time commitment. I'm afraid that we have a reputation of being a bunch of old people who happily maintain our massive flower gardens, and that's just not how people are gardening nowadays, so we need to work on our image.

It provides fulfilling volunteer opportunities for gardeners looking to give back to the community and meet other gardeners. |I would like to rethink the parameters around the CE hours requirement. It seems that some of the sanctioned classes/talks/shows are not as good as reading a good book on a topic that particularly interests me.|Allow community volunteers to participate in gardening projects along with MGVs. It does not take a year of training to know how to weed a garden and a more welcoming attitude may lead to more interest in the program.|There seems to be a lot of paperwork and concern about bureaucracy

After you are in the program for a long while, the educational opportunites seem redundant|"I do not know of competitors, only that people often prefer to garden, even if working in public settings, without the hours reporting and background checks, etc., of the program.  The only other groups doing similar things in our area are ""garden clubs"".  They often do similar work with no other requirements except to show up when they please and pitch in."

74|Master Gardener Volunteer|0-5|Female|45-64|The MG Program connects me with people who have similar passion for growing plants, flowers, vegetables, and trees.   I have met people in my own city that I would never have met otherwise.  These friendships have led to trading plants, fun-filled tours of each others garden and much conversation|The program seems soooooo old.  I'm in my early 50s and many of my fellow program members are retired.  They want to have meetings in the daytime when I work.  And the way we each look at things--approaches to programs, etc--is very different.  But the biggest issue I see overall is a lack of modern technology -- no dynamic website, blog, Facebook, Instagram.  I love the fact we now have an online hours reporting system.   I would feel better if the entire organization embraced a more modern methodology to sharing information.  It would also be great to have the ability to try create new programs to support cool locations.  Perhaps embrace a beautification program that created key points of natural glory at city entrances?  Make our contributions more public.  More noticeable.  |Embrace modern technology.  Web sites.  Social media.  Web-based programming and learning.   These opportunities provide--on-line Master Gardener training that could increase membership.  Allow a Master Gardener Volunteer to remain a member in his/her hometown and contribute.  Bring in a younger group of people as video and on-line learning is the way they are used to learning.  Having training in a video format lessens the large responsibility for the Education Chair--a challenge we are seeing in our own Chapter.   It also provides the ability to offer classes MORE OFTEN, allowing for MORE MEMBERS, in a way that MORE PEOPLE can continue to connect.  How about providing a life feed of the education presentations at meetings through a sign on, on-line portal for members only?  A facebook and/or Instagram account allowing Master Gardener Volunteers to brag and show what is in their own garden.  Web-based interaction allows for greater interaction between states or even local in-state chapters.  We just need to get more modern.  |Our chapter is mostly retired individuals.  I appreciate them and enjoy being part of a diverse group.  However, the group feels old.  I didn't see it as clearly until I finished the classes and went to meetings/events regularly.  In comparison, I see my local gardening group (Cedarburg Gardening Club) recognizing they are in a similar position and reaching out to groups of younger women and personally inviting them to meetings as a guest to check it out.  Existing members actively reach out to these guests and engage with them.   We don't have that ability.  
75|Master Gardener Volunteer|10+|Female|45-64|Well organized for a large group, not that the communication can be better but for a large group it is good. I like the number, variety of ways to volunteer.|Communication. I avoid the the complainers, people that want the program organized to their specific desires.|I think youth education is important |If reporting, volunteering, getting education requirements are to much of a burden you lose your base.
76|Master Gardener Volunteer|10+|Female|65+|Education and volunteering together - how can anything be better?|Public relations is a weakness - promotion of the program on going is needed.|Next generation gardeners want a new garden ethic.  Nights and weekend programs necessary to interest this group.|Internet self education is both good and bad for traditional educational programs.  Improve internet programming. 
77|Master Gardener Volunteer|0-5|Female|25-44|Provides excellent education, provides valuable gardening services to nonprofits/the community|I am new to the program, so hard to say exactly, but so far, many of the volunteer opportunities I have seen are not geared towards those who work full time (eg. I have a regular job, so cannot volunteer at 9 AM on a weekday). This seems to gear the program more toward those who are retired or not working full time. If you would like to increase the age diversity of master gardeners, the diversity of times that opportunities are available would also have to be increased.|I'm not sure|State funding always seems to be an obstacle. Attracting a more diverse group of people is probably also an obstacle - it is a little difficult for me to feel welcome as a 33-year-old in a group that feels like is majority retired people, even if we do share a common gardening interest (see earlier comments about timing of events). I can see how ethnic minorities would also have trouble feeling welcome in such a group.
78|County Coordinator/Educator|0-5|Female|25-44|The program does an amazing job with the learning materials for the classroom and flipped classroom models. I think the newsletters and trip opportunities are great opportunties for the Master Gardeners as well. This program excited me because multiple generations are abkle to come together and do good in their communities. I also enjoy the fact it goes across the state and we have other individuals and groups to work with and learn from to help give ideas for their groups. |"I would love to see more direction on volunteer role descriptions, how to work with ""friends of the MG's"", projects, online reporting system, WIMGA and MG's (Extension side) on how they work together. Nothing that I can think of to eliminate or avoid though. "|More community outreach and trainings for the public. Also, more training and learning opportunities on how to teach and do these type of programs for the MG's. I think we need to embrace the fact many younger gernations want to grow and produce their own food and do good in the communities. I thinkwe have a lot of opportunties, but need to work on the marketing to help recruite these individuals.|"""It's only women in MG's"", misunderstandings of the background checks and MRT/VIP, fear of teaching, aging out, all the same community memebers doing all the volunteer work in a community for multiple organizations. I think competitors are any other garden clubs or volunteering groups. "
79|Master Gardener Volunteer|10+|Female|65+|People seem to know about us and look up to us for advice on gardening.  In Jefferson the master gardeners have started working with kids in grade school and in high school and created a community garden as well as a beautiful park for people to enjoy. We are making the city a better place and that is exciting!|Recording our hours in different categories is sometimes difficult and time consuming.  I don't always know which one I should be using.  I just want to do volunteer gardening projects and not deal with which column it falls under. Also, why can't hours spent reading informative gardening books be counted as education.  We can learn from them, too.|simplifying the recording of hours would help|no comment
80|Master Gardener Volunteer|0-5|Female|25-44|Connects me to like minded individuals. For instance, gardening in front of a hospital attracts different folk than gardening in front of a library. So not do i find gardening connections i find other connections as well. I like the learning opportunities, especially online since I'm a pretty busy middle aged mom with other commitments to work, children, school etc. |People essentially fighting over certain volunteer opportunities or experiences. You are a huge organization, yet you offer limited spaces for listening to live talks, or giving talks. You require hours but I've heard from the younger, working crowd a lack of weekend, nighttime opportunities in general. Stop acting small. I also think some sponsered gardens are run way better than others. Auditing for best management practices and then cross training might help. Im not saying there isn't more than one way to run a garden, the is and should be for diversity, but there are good and bad practices. Having a standard set of places to buy supplies like mulch would be better. And finally, your marketing to the public sucks. When i told my new neighbor i was a master gardener, he thought for months i was some sort of weird braggart until someone else explained what we do. There is a movement among younger generations right now to garden, yet we aren't getting the requests or lots of younger folk joining. Instead, random blogs and self proclaimed experts get the billing. That's crazy|When i volunteered for the mdc it was set up very different. Not better necessarily as it was more exclusive. But the one thing i took away from it was if you want future tax dollars you have to get them loyal and interested before they can vote. Give them cherished memories. Marketing 101. I think the lack of focus on the young is crazy. I was part of the youth committee and it was a disaster mostly due to a lack of support. There should be events for families that aren't the state fair or its just showing up on request, a push to go into schools,etc. We have a huge older population that might connect well with young buddies. And our lack of social media is appalling. Where's the instagram, the blog, the youtube. It's 2019 and you are losing a whole generation. We have several marketing professionals as volunteers, use them. |Honestly, your volunteers keep dying. That are awesome and so much knowledge and love, but you need a better balance of ages. The other is the lack of funding. There should be more fundraising, and more political influencing. Your competitors are ost gardening organizations that kettle turn to. Your information, although valuable, is written for us. A 24 yr old is going to go to a video, blog, podcast, pinterest, basically anything before you for information. Which makes you irrelevant. Which means you die a long slow death. 
81|Master Gardener Volunteer|10+|Female|65+|i Have found the online learning so inspiring. I have enjoyed the Level 2 programs that gave me information but also set expectations for me to complete. I really liked hearing and seeing the presentations online from the expert lecturers. I am asked to provide presentations and have made use of some of their ways of presenting information to the MG online with my programs. The power points I’ve made as part of the required learning session several years ago helped me to incorporate them into my presentations and are a very good learning tool.|We don’t have a MG county organization, and yet we have very active MGs. I am a very active MG and through my interaction with others, I am able to promote the MG program, and others have completed the MG program because they have a true desire to improve the works in their own way, using the knowledge that the support from UW Extension and the MG provides. I  know the budget cuts affect every program and I have been told by several new MGs how disappointed they were with their basic training by using MGs from their counties to provide the weekly classes. I was able to have training that was televised in 2008 in our county and UW instructors covered each chapter of the material in our “MG Bibles”. I refer to my notes and that wonderful binder as a basis for every project I begin. I have that carried knowledge with me in every aspect of my projects and programs these past years and I aspire to make these instructors proud of how I’m using their information and guidance. I really could use at least an annual “boost” where MGs can hear from Mike, Amy, and other educators to let me know how we are doing as an organization and what we can each continue to do to improve ourselves and the MG organization. Maybe a webinar would be feasible. |I am constantly trying to get younger people involved in taking interest and pride in our local communities. I did find that just deciding to get a group together at a local library to clean up a large , visible area brought out community people to join us. The best part was getting a mother to include organizing a spring cleanup of the library by inviting mothers from a kids’ library session to give it a try. No matter what organization I am involved in, getting parents and children involved is challenging. |I know that every program has faced budget constraints and Extension has really been affected. As people become more complacent and don’t take the initiative to learn how important out natural resources are to our wonderful life as we know it, the more jeopardize the MG program and those providing the education and support needed to maintain it, will be. Many elected officials don’t understand the importance of Extension programs and what a priceless return there is for every dollar invested into them.
82|Master Gardener Volunteer|0-5|Female|45-64|Great opportunity for life long learning|Better bridging to other gardening organizations in the local area so more and more visible projects can be accomplished|With the introduction of the numerous invasive species better local programming on better planning and planting.  For instance, better education on outcome of the ash tree debacle and what we can learn from it...how we as an organization can better combat our ever evolving flora.  We as a group need to better define organic and stick to it and help ease the insane notions the general public has about what organic really is|"The generation of ""allergic to volunteering"" is upon us and the lack of new people interested in giving of their time is rampant.  Programming needs to pique their interest and tell a story they will listen to in order to get them involved.  Right now perception is something they cannot embrace because they don't connect to it."
83|Master Gardener Volunteer|43595|Female|45-64|It gets a lot of community service accomplished and it a great way of organizing those efforts efficiently.|There isn't enough oversight from extension - MGVs pretty much use their own knowledge to benefit the community. The MG association in our area is openly hostile to extension and I know that this is a problem in other places as well. There doesn't seem to be any overarching strategy or even actionable goals. MGVs have ideas for projects and if there's enough interest they continue, but it all seems really piecemeal.|I think there needs to be more statewide coordination and sharing. Where are the standard talks that MGVs can give to the community? (tomatoes, vegetable gardening, the importance of soil testing for your lawn, etc.) We have a tremendous opportunity to bring research findings to the community but we do a terrible job of that. We mostly weed, frankly, and while that's a service it's not the best use of the program by any means.|The funding situation is dire. Extension isn't a valued part of UW, and the MGV program isn't a valued part of extension. Maybe changing our focus so that it's obvious to an outsider (like Tallamy's approach with birds, insects, and native plants) why horticulture/gardening is important, or offering more for small commercial growers like truck farmers or people who would sell at a farmers market or part of a CSA. There's no good reason why Kenosha and Racine would be partnered with Milwaukee - the 2 programs have completely different foci. I can easily see the MGV program fading from lack of funding and really poor decisions like this one (let's put disparate counties together!). It just showcases the lack of importance that this program has to the higher ups. It's unfortunate because it is a great community builder, gets people outside, gives older people a great way to use their knowledge and give back, and gets the younger generations interested in plants, food, gardening, community service, etc.
84|Master Gardener Volunteer|10+|Female|45-64|Gardening as a group you learn from other people. I like the program because it is flexible with my schedule.

With climate change being real, issues are popping up that groups working together would be more effective. If there are invasive species happening near parks,lakes why not get the word out with master gardeners helping to inform the public along w Dnr and parks departments. |Obviously, master gardeners are interested in helping.

I've been here a short time, but I have heard that many of the projects people count are not initiated by the MGA or the Educator.  This makes it harder to have cohesive ""projects"" that are measurable and meaningful.  I think the process for approving projects could be improved.  (I also know of individual-initiated projects that are fantastic.)   "|More and more people want to garden.  I think that is a huge strength.  I worry about who the master gardeners are as far as demographics (Mostly white, elderly, female).  I think expanding who we attract is a definite area of growth.

In addition to our service to the community these projects also contain an important educational component for both adult and children in the community.  This helps to foster interest in gardening.

What should our focus for educating the public be?   Should the core projects submit a request for funding at the beginning of the year and a budget worked out by a budget committee from the group that includes a wide range of members, not just the board?

119|Master Gardener Volunteer|10+|Female|65+|The greatest strength of the Master Gardener program is attracting the public to utilize their neighbors and friends as a reliable resource of information related to gardening and landscaping.   I believe that the training for new MG’s is adequate however I do think an internship of some type with enhance the new MG’s confidence in their knowledge.   The program continues to excite me even after 19 years of participation because of what I have witnessed to be possible with group of “like minded people”.   In our region much has been accomplices for natural beauty of the area and an increased fresh food supply for all.   |I mentioned an internship.  Thinking of a more structured one, than the current one we have. Assisting the new volunteers to identify their interest, abilities and their time available.  Possibly setting up a level system of various levels of profiency related to interest.   We can’t all be good and knowledgeable at everything.  |The trends of ecology and global weather changes should be added to every faciet of the education process and included in all continuing education.  The information should be practical information, addressing the changes and easy to incorporate into gardening and landscaping preferences.|Obsticles always present opportunities.   I believe the internship program would be an opportunity to draw people in and offer volunteer opportunities to enhance the individuals knowledge base.   Competitors will be present, not sure they are recognized.   We are volunteers, probably working with a different population of more needy people such as schools, elderly housing and non-profits.

We are an important part of this state, the economy, the community and need to be recognized as such. Improve the pace of moving forward. I have seen three years of unanswered questions, confusion and feel that this is a negative impact on master gardeners and the association. |New trends: Make sure extension office has funds for training & educating community groups. Master gardeners are available to help educate, inform and 'spark joy' to Wisconsin citizens, aka taxpayers. Make sure our county office has the support personnel to help set up, direct and implement community outreach programs. e.g.: community gardens in 'desert' areas of poor communities, help local food banks keep their shelves & bins full of produce to distribute. Educate our children so no one talks about buying their groceries at the quick mart or that chocolate milk comes from brown cows.|Obstacles: indifference from the university. Cutting back on extension services. As we shrink in staff and outreach, our competitors are the 'big box' stores who give out incorrect information, push homeowners/taxpayers toward expensive chemicals and unnecessary gadgets.

Some of the newer volunteers have more experience and are more knowledgeable than long time members.   Why do we have such a large bank account?  Why aren't we giving out scholarships?"|The ergo part of gardening is a great addition.  Wanted to join the group, but calls and e-mails go unanswered.

This was inefficient.  I would suggest that people do some of the training via web loaded videos of prior excellent presenters to cover “content”, a post-viewing quiz could be fashioned (as per the bound training manual), to give student/presenter an impression of adequate preparation (or not), and then group meetings could occur to handle questions and special cases.  As “coverage of content” took more than 2/3 of the time, questions for three different topics could be covered in the same evening meeting.  There were way too few group activities in training last fall, so almost no advantage was taken of getting people together.|The aging baby boomer population is a trend which will initially increase, then reduce the volunteer population.

We could maybe work together. Many of us have a variety of skills that include soils and composting, to wildlife, to praire plants.   We need to focus on eliminating invasive species and NOT exchanging or giving away some of those very aggressive plants to some unsuspecting new gardener. We need to be a caretaker of our natural resources.  I think we have a variety of skills and knowledge, but need an organizer to get MG involved with other things such as species monitoring, invasive plants/insects controlling and maintenance. Look at MG as professionals.  We have many a life skills as well, but we all need to keep on learning.|One obstacle is teh aging MG volunteeers themselves adn the decline in numbers due to a variety of reasons (age, background checks, administrative things some disagree with).

207|Master Gardener Volunteer|10+|Female|45-64|Strengths are: 1.there is a consistent and well researched education program across all 72 counties. 2. UW Extension is involved in the MGV Program, demonstrating the Wisconsin Idea at work. 3. UW and UW Extension staff provide sound support and contributions to the program. 4. The requirements for MGV participation help ensure that volunteers' work in the community is based on evidence based recommendations and delivered by people who have had background checks and training. 5. The MGV Program helps provide community support in schools, community gardens, juvenile facilities, senior centers and many more areas. 6. The MGV provides for networking with other MGV's across the state and nation.|The MGV Program could be improved forming connections and collaborations with other UW programming and community efforts.

There isn't sufficient recognition of the programs and benefits by federal, state and county partners to maintain programs, staff and resources. Funding is an obstacle. Demographics can be an obstacle as programs must adapt to appeal to younger interests and constraints on time. I do not see the MGV Program, as I know it, having real competition. It gets back to building in person relationships. Should the MGV Program move more towards online programming, then YouTube will compete for providing information and the volunteerism will suffer.

The MG program needs more funding from the state. We see the minute and awful craziness of counting hours, apportioning every teensy bit of service and costs here and there.

239|Master Gardener Volunteer|10+|Female|45-64|First of all I think the Master Gardener program focuses on education of the community with their respective gardens and the individual members going out into the public to pass along their knowledge about the gardening techniques. Personally I am excited to be able to share information I have learned through the organisations seminar opportunities and different classes offered. I love being a member of such a worth while organisation in our community. Being able to assist and answer questions from new gardeners on better and safer ways to gardens makes me feel that I am making a difference . |I think new members coming to our meetings that have never been there before could benefit from a printout explaining better what the organisation is all about and by having MG classes again to certify new people. I would eliminate little boxes like these to write in that make it harder to proof read before sending it to next page. |Be involved with the local schools more to get the kids started early on with gardening. Maybe have classes at the library just for young people.|The only threat I see is of age. A lot of our members are growing older and cannot take care of the projects as well. We need to recruit the younger members. Maybe work with the local college to enlist some new members by maybe they would be required to attend 1-2 of our meetings or seminars. Our seminars could parallel some of the things they are studying.

What I saw was many people with questions. Glad to have information on hand, and someone to talk to. But more importantly a sheet of information in hand on how to get their questions answered. I met MG from all over the state. They would come to the Booth and say what county they were from.They were Happy to See a presense in such a setting. |"I do not know much of how the program has been running. I do know that in the Horticultural industry MG have had a bad reputation. Part of this is due to individuals going into businesses and telling people ""Well I am a Master Gardner I know all about this"".. I was actually happy to hear in the classes that this type of behaviour is frowned upon. There will always be individuals, but it is a much better attitude out there. "|One of the things that we did in Oregon in the MG program was to build raised bed gardens for Low income families. Then a MG volunteer worked with them to plan their garden, and give them information on how to work their garden.

We should be allowed to endorse our favorite nurseries.  We should be more knowledgeable about plant id and MGVs should be encouraged to grow gardens on their property (so many city MGV dwellers do not garden on a personal level.)

We are also having an issue with people stepping up into leadership positions -I think bc there isn’t enough incentive.  Competitors include organizations with real budgets, like Rotary.

We also provide over $3500 per year for community, school and public gardening grants.  I love that our focus is on education, social interaction among MGVs and volunteerism|MAMGA went through a year-long strategic planning process in 2015.  We eliminated a number of traditional garden grants, reduced spending on non-core mission efforts, focused on programming and education for our members and for teaching gardens, and improved our relationship to and support of Extension.  For our association of MGVs we feel we have improved our organization in the first four years of our five year plan.  But we are always looking at ways to improve the delivery of our mission--education, social cohesion among MGVs, and volunteerism |We think our programs need to be synchronous rather than competitive with the other garden clubs and associations in Dane County.  Therefore we try to support the programs of Olbrich, Allen Centennial Garden, the Arboretum, West Ag Research, the Extension Teaching Garden, and Wisconsin Hardy Plant Society.  We have staged major symposiums with the school garden community and the community garden association.  We have given grants to Allen Centennial and Olbrich gardens that help support garden volunteerism and education.  We strongly support partnerships that enhance the volunteer activities of master gardeners and strengthen our Dane County communities.|For the Madison Area Master Gardener Association I see no competitors, only partners.  No one I've met either in the non-profit sector or in the green business sector competes with our MGVs.

The programs connection to University resources (information, research, technology, brand, specialists, administration, support staff, AND Local staff) to support community engagement and outreach.  The MGV program is exciting because it provides a venue and structure for community members to network around and bring people from a variety of backgrounds (mostly retired, white, women, and a few men, some with very skilled life experiences, and others with a more local real-world local perspective) together to improve their communities.  In my opinion, and in my efforts as a staff, I really try to manage MGV to carry out the Purpose, Vision and Values of Extension.  Volunteers while a challenge to manage at times can collectively do so much and provide services that no one else does.|I really like the changes that have happened in recent years.  In particular the learning modules, and other web-based information.  This centralization of information and resources is nice to have and provides MGV easy to find resources to stay connected and gain a better understanding of the program.  With that said, I would hope that as more and more information and procedures are added to the website or on-line that the process be as simple and clean and straight forward as possible.  It's on thing to have to navigate on-line reporting, and other HR or administration requirements as an employee, but please don't make volunteers get bogged down in policy and over the top reporting.  It can be challenging enough to keep volunteers motivated.  Adding frustration of navigating on-line requirements will only make things more challenging.    Its a big challenge I get it, but too much bureaucracy will discourage participation.  I try to balance this sometimes rather large hurtle of policy and admin asks with the reward of being part of a world-class University and having access to world-class resources.  |Finding ways to diversify our MGV in terms of age, gender, race and ethnicity.  Without diversity the program can be looked at in ways it should not. MGV is only for retired people, or their focus is only on flowers or kids.  In my opinion, MGV will continue to be dominated by retired women (more so then men) just given our baby boomer demographics and our location, which is fine, however, I have seen the change in the group dynamics and openness to new ideas when there is diversity (younger women, more working aged volunteers, differences in soci-economic status,ethnicity).  Continue to engage and train volunteers in using technology, offer training on using powerpoint, or taking photos/videos, writing blogs, how to set up blogs, websites, social media, how to write promotional materials).  Is their a similar training to Responding to Hort Inquires that focuses on soft skills, or people skills. |Don't make being a 'certified' MGV the end all.  Not all volunteers are created equal, or can maintain certified status indefinitely.  Avoid putting volunteers into classes.  I'm certified your not.  We have to find a way to bridge our spring trainees to becoming certified so we don't lose them.  For some getting 24 hours in after training ends in June can be a challenge.  Keeping volunteers motivated and connected.  The current award certificates are okay, but perhaps there is other ways to recognize MGV.  Our competition is other organizations who offer similar or more exciting opportunities.  While garden clubs may appear similar they are NOT.  Keeping a diverse membership and dynamic training, professional development and programming sets us apart.

425|Master Gardener Volunteer|10+|Female|65+|The opportunity and encouragement to keep learning and contribute to society excites me. The program does a great job of offering a variety of opportunities for continuing education and volunteering which inspires new ideas.|"I would make the students and the teachers of the Master Gardener Program become engaged right from the beginning in the MG association in their area. It seems to me that very few students complete the education program and get involved in the ongoing association--they do not even visit! As for older members, I know people who consider themselves to be MG's but hardly ever,if ever come to a meeting but they still somehow get their continuing education and volunteer hours accepted. I'm not sure they should be able to ""get away"" with this lack of committment to the program. I would send an e-mail to every MG in the nation and tell them that they MUST go to at least 1/2 of the local association meetings and get 1/2 of their continuing education and volunteer hours through the organization's activities. That would really help support the activities of the local association--such as ours where there are supposed to be 50+ MG's in the area but only 10 people are showing up to the meetings, doing all of the work, and putting together an annual spring seminar. It is a burnout for those of us doing all of the work and others sitting on their hands and still considered MG's. It is insulting."|I think the program could really do more in the communities across the country if ALL of the MG's were involved in doing something together. There's power in numbers and a great opportunity for socialization and education when people come together to learn and work. I really like the idea of community gardens and we are lucky to have an excellent one. It's important for people to know how to grow their own food and school gardens seem to be a place we are called to be involved with. On-line education across the state or nation would be a very helpful way for MG's to hear or see world-class speakers at their meetings/seminars and would bring more members into the meetings.|The biggest threat I see is the aging population of MG's with few younger people getting involved. I think the MG teachers/state leaders need to visit the technical colleges, universities and get young people in agriculture, forestry, horticulture into the MG program. Also students in 4H should be recruited.

I feel strongly about how integral that is, since less young people are exposed to natural living overall, and don't pursue it in advanced education.  Locally in our county, I think that we do a wonderful job implementing our ""Microgarden"" program in our elementary schools.  We also have been acknowledged for the quality of one of our large-scale events called, ""Let's Get Green and Growing.""  Personally, I think our county delivers an excellent MGV education program at the UW-Extension office.  Without which, I would not know the basics of horticulture.  Therefore, we are making an impact on individuals, communities, and even to groups outside our community.   "|I think our local program would benefit from more recruiting and outreach in order to increase membership.  Ideally, volulnteer management would involve the guidance of placing volunteers in posiitons that suit their personalities and skills.

I'm most excited about learning more and more through experience.|Well, I attended the banquet in October and the general public financial meeting at the GBBC.  When I found out that our volunteer hours generated a financial profit, the wheels began turning.  Ninety four thousand dollars in 2018 was the amount protected on the screen.  Great!  We have funds for growth.  I have attended two volunteer meetings and we have been told we only have $300.00 to spend per garden.  Not only that, we don't have a truck, garden trailer or tillers for our projects.  I'm asking that the funds by generated from our volunteer work be channeled back into the Master Gardener Volunteer program.  This is our mutual fund investment in our present and future gardening efforts.  We want to see growth and satisfaction among the current members, membership retention and greater numbers of new volunteers.  For this to happen,we need plenty of modern equipment, accessible equipment, and more soil, seed, and potting supplies money|We should try to embrace the other Master Gardener programs in the state.  Invite the nearest ones to visit our gardens, publish articles and pictures of our gardens in the newspaper and online.   I think the Master Gardener Volunteer program is rich with opportunity at this time. |This program will die without growth generated by the hours of volunteer work contributed.

467|Master Gardener Volunteer|43595|Female|45-64|Training & education (although I think the beginning training class could use some tweaking), also the variety of volunteer opportunities available. I am passionate about gardening and want to always keep learning about gardening.  I like making a difference in the community by gardening.  |Level 1 training needs some changes ( of course it may have changes, this is just what I remembered from when I took it) I felt the last few weeks of classwork was very rushed, didn't take time to go through all of the material. So perhaps reorganize the class schedule - extend by a week or so?  My local group (Southeast MG) needs some improvement in communication.  The program overall needs to be more visible and known to the community. Many people I talk to have never heard about the Master Gardener program.  We should be well known in our communities. |Our strengths are our training and our passion for gardening.  We need to find new ways to connect with the community about gardening in the community and for peoples personal gardens. |It's hard to get people to volunteer in general due to busy lives and demanding kid schedules.  And that doesn't look like it will change anytime soon.  We need to be creative in different ways people can volunteer their time.  I'm not saying get rid of or reduce required volunteer hours - that is important. Awareness in our community is an obstacle - if people don't know about our program or how we impact the community then we will see less new members.  The majority of MGV in my group are retirement age.  What happens when they can't garden any longer?  Will we have enough new people to come in and take over projects?

What exites me about the program:  1) I get to do something I love which is help others .. in venues that are beautiful, exciting and challenging AND I am forever learning.|1)  Publish the student manual for ALL the general population to buy and use.  Many out there would buy it and learn tons from it.  Fund raising.. come up with new ideas.  I think the SE Wisconsin plant sale is extremely labor-intensive - especially for an aging population.  I recommend an annual gardening calendar.. such as the Placer county of California's gardening calendar.  I'd really like to know more how other Wisconsin MGV areas function.. as well as others on a national level.  And.. are we really MASTER gardeners?  I don't think so.  We're trained.. but not on a 'Master' level.  And 'Master Gardener Volunteers Who Do Plant Advising'  REALLY ?  That's the best they could do?  For one thing, they are advising on a whole lot more than just plants, we are involved in things botanical and zoological.  Need to improve that title, please.  I would ask too that the state update emails contain the latest hot issues and forget about the exotic plant info.   |Urban gardening as a source of food supply.  More civic gardens that enhance beauty and supply more ecological benefits.  Eldergartens near nursing homes, garden support for more schools. More presence at Farmers Markets.  A 'Gardenmobile'.. like a bookmobile.. travel to communities.. time it so it's at cities during a community festival.. or .. ?   We have to be where the people are to be available to the general population.  Garden Fest.  |Threats to MGV program = burdensome layers of bureaucracy, potential for it to be seen as 'not valuable' to the state of Wisconsin budget makers.  Competitors = Some landscape &/or garden centers now offering how-to classes.  Why don't we offer more How-To classes?  I think our biggest problem is not enough people know about us.  We should march in a few parades .. like the Ice Age Trail Alliance does in Whitewater's 4th of July parade.

We are fortunate to have a passionate, engaged group of volunteers who are willing to teach others all aspects of gardening.  Because the average age in Door County is in the 50s, most of our volunteers are retired, experienced gardeners with vast life experiences to add.  I love the program and am involved as coordinator of the Training Committee, co-chair of The Garden Door (our showcase garden), and I keep track of Community projects.  I am personally involved in many project activities to varying degrees.  I need to mention our greenhouse activities and annual plant sale which funds our education program.|I feel that communication could be better between our local county Educator and our organization.  We have had several meetings regarding our concerns over the future of our training in the county and other concerns that arise.

We are willing to work with her on changes that she envisions, (change is good), but she has not asked for our help or input.  We always request meeting with her, she doesn’t often contact us for input.  For our continued success, we need to have a better, more open line of communication.  I feel the training should remain at its thirteen week status.  It would be difficult for students to take in more info and spend longer time together to shorten up the course.  Perhaps we can try alternative training processes IN ADDITION TO the program that we already have in place.  Possibly need to pare down the number of projects that we are involved in.

Generally smart and interesting volunteers who are ready to help and a pleasure to work with on projects.|Lack of diversity--in age, race, and horticultural experiences. The vast majority of the volunteers are suburban perennial gardeners who know a lot about the current plants promoted by the nursery industry and less about native plants, trees, shrubs, pests, vegetables, fruits and other concerns that community members have. Although these other subjects and ways to serve the community are taught during Level 1 classes, there is little incentive for MGVs to learn or work in these areas or in different parts of the community. Too many old-fashioned ideas about gardening rather than current thinking in horticulture and what it can do to improve communities. Eliminate most of the gardens and keep only those that are actual demonstration gardens with classes or events. Most of the garden projects are long time holdovers that have very little educational value and seem more to be more about free landscaping services for nonprofits than places for public projects.|Horticultural therapy and using horticulture as healing for trauma and stress. Helping with nature and environmental education, such as water management (rain gardens) and pollinators. |Lack of good training in how to be a volunteer and talk with the public. How volunteers want to spend time and fitting volunteer time into MGV schedules. Even retired people are much busier than they used to be. We are having trouble getting volunteers to commit to regular volunteer times or participate in leadership of projects or our association because it takes extra time and a regular commitment. Most MGVs only record the minimum number of required hours or a little more. Need more winter activities to keep people involved in the program. Long gap time between fall Level 1 classes and when new MGVs can work in gardens or on projects. We can lose both new and certified MGVs during these months of time when many do not participate in the program.

This enhances that person's sense of self-worth and contributes to positive outcomes in the community.  I get excited about the opportunities that are available in the program.|I would improve Monroe County's involvement in the Master Gardener Program.  Presently, there are no training opportunities available to residents of Monroe County.  My husband and I had to travel to Black River Falls for our initial training.  If UW-Extension believes the program is important and enough people in a community want to be involved in MG activities, the local extension agent should show some interest and/or provide the training. It seems as though local programs are as effective as the interest level of the local agent.|I believe the MG program could do more partnering with school gardens and/or community gardens.  I say this only because there is little to no opportunities for us to be involved in these activities in Sparta.  Volunteers wanting to be involved and active are the program's greatest strengths as well as the number of retired people who are MG's and have a lot of time on their hands.  Partnering with the local technical colleges could also be an opportunity to expand the program.|"The only obstacles I foresee are the ones I mentioned previously--i.e. lack of interest or ability to provide a MG program locally.

620|Master Gardener Volunteer|0-5|Female|45-64|As a member of MAMGA board and Community Services Grants coordinator, we strive to educate the public, schools and community garden members about the benefits of gardening.  Each year we see increasing interest in our grant program with some very innovative work going on at school and community gardens. I, along with other Board members, enjoy visiting the sites to learn from the projects but also to make sure MAMGA funds are spent to meet the goals.  I also greatly enjoy the garden visits (Olbrich, Epic, Rotary, etc) and diverse programs that MAMGA offers. |What would help is to have more funds available for our increasingly popular Community Services Grants program. We are limited to $2000 unless we pull from our reserve fund. We have spent quite a bit of time organizing the grant application and review process to ensure we have the information we need to make funding decisions. The grant scoring workgroup is made up of 4-5 individuals to ensure fairness in consideration of grants.  I would like to see our membership numbers improve. People need to understand that they don't have to be certified OR actively gardening to enjoy the benefits of membership which include the great educational programs. This might keep some of the older people involved.|We will continue to embrace the idea of assisting students and members of the communities understand the value of vegetable and flower gardening, both for good nutrition and mental health.|The University's requirement to do a background check (my opinion) scared off possible members. The certification process seems to be complicated for some people who just decide to let it go and drop their membership.  Again, they should be encouraged to be non-certified members for the sake of the other benefits. While several other entities offer grant programs to schools and community gardens, I don't perceive them as significant competition. Again, increased funding for MAMGA Community Service Grants would eliminate the growing obstacle of being short on funds.

Also- as enriching as continuing ed. is, I feel that after a few years as a Master Gardener, perhaps this component could be waived or lessened.  I find a lot of continuing ed., though beneficial, repeats from one year to the next.|Several Master Gardeners that I know are not planning on continuing with the program.  This is due to 2 reasons- inability to volunteer enough hours to maintain their active status (this is especially true for Master Gardeners who are still working outside of the home); and continuing ed. expectations.  At the same time, there is still appears to be a significant need for master gardener help.  Perhaps by loosening some requirements, we might be able to keep these volunteers engaged until they have more time in their schedule to be more active with the program.|I recently learned about the Master Naturalist Program, and am thinking of pursuing that.  I would love to participate in both, but would not be able to maintain the level of volunteer hours in both combined.  I had been volunteering at Boerner Gardens; and now am interested in also volunteering as a Naturalist at Retzer Nature Center.  In contacting Ann Weid, I'm only able to count my MG hours if it's specifically working in the garden, or something else related specifically with gardening at Retzer.  Would be nice if the two programs could be blended or shared in terms of volunteer hours.  I'm guessing that a number MG volunteers may also be interested naturalists as well

Educates through interaction with other local gardeners and overcoming the challenges of the local growing environment.|I would eliminate the formality of some of the participation restrictions. When the effort to conform to  policy and regulation out weighs the enjoyment and  eagerness to volunteer, then membership declines .   Volunteering has to be fun as well as productive  and meaningful.  Once someone steps in and overrides all of that for establishing another program or  insisting on conformity to new rules and regulations and is not sensitive to the membership, sustainability of the organization will suffer and the individual member's sense of value will be significantly diminished.   |The training and education aspect opens up opportunities for getting the membership involved and uniting existing members with the new.  the need for organization sustainability especially when it's volunteer  driven can be stabilized with more connection with the university extension outreach. |In Door County there are many organizations that are affiliated with the parks, nature conservancies and restorations projects.  Many of our volunteers are  involved with 2 - 3 of the areas organizations.  When being a Master Gardener becomes less fun or the expectations that are imposed on the 25 - 40% of the members who do all the volunteer work, becomes too much and not fun, they quit.

I would avoid restricting volunteer activities to specific categories or making reporting complicated.  For example, avoid the requirement to volunteer a specified number of hours in a specified number of categories. |The program needs to recognize that our members are mostly retirees and that the age for retirement is climbing which may affect the abilities of our members.

Community outreach allows gardening to come alive for others who may not be exposed otherwise.  Group projects deepen relationships with other MGs.|Outstays groups have limited contact with state level staff.  Minimal monetary support directed to the MGs.  For instance, each year MN provides the local groups with banners, handouts, etc. to be used throughout the summer. We have to purchase al of these items with our own funds.  There is a challenge in keeping the MG program distinct and separate from other “garden” clubs.  Retention of certified MGs is a challenge and creative thinking is needed.|Food security is critical and MGs can and do play an important role.  |Cuts in funding can ruin this program.  If the contributed dollars of the MGs was gone,  you couldn’t afford to pay to fill the resulting gap.  Again, better visibility and outreach by the state office in outlying areas is critical.  Loss of skilled, local coordinators would be the biggest risk.  Competition for personal volunteer time of the MGs is a risk.  Other garden groups that can attract away volunteers are competitors.  Again lack of funding and desire to promote the program by UW is a significant risk.
