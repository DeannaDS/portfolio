# Air Quality Data Exploration - a Big Data Approach

This project compares national air quality data available via the EPA with hyper local data available from a personal air quality monitoring device attached to my home.

The PDF in this project gives detailed directions for loading and running the project, either using Hortonworks or Amazon Web Services. The code is available as a json file that generates a Zeppelin notebook and uses Scala/Spark to process the data.

The data is too large for github, but can be downloaded via [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18M_jDzCvnMqCx9DGcfuJGLyhdJhcCv67).

Additionally, there is a [Tableau visualization](https://public.tableau.com/profile/deanna.schneider5405#!/vizhome/AirPollutionNearMe/PM252017DataExploration) of the resulting data sets.
