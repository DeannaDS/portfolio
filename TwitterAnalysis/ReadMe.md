# Twitter Analysis - Statistical Difference in Verb Usage for Two Timely Social Media Campaigns

This project used the Python API to collect tweets that used either the hashtag "metoo" or "takeaknee" - two activist hashtags that had gained momentum in 2017. After collection, I split the tweets into grammatical parts of speech using natural language processing in Python.

After the Python work, the data was ported to R, and statistical analysis was conducted to determine if there was a statistically significant difference between the use of verbs in tweets using each hashtag.
